1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:07,759
I'm Scott. I'm Russell. And I'm Leo. This is Spitball.

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome to Spitball, where three solution seekers and a guest empty their heads of startup and tech product ideas that they have stuck up in there so you can all have them for free.

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,599
Anything that we say is yours to keep. And Russell, you brought our guest this week, right?

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:41,640
I did. I brought the incredible Kayla. She's doing amazing stuff with people. She helps people any way she can. I'm going to keep it at that.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Wow.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,199
That's a way of saying you have no idea what I do.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,180
She's nice. She's fun. She's cool.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,480
She gets people out of bad situations. We'll say that.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,379
We're so excited to have Kayla here.

10
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:57,800
Batman?

11
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:11,119
I just don't want, I don't want, you know, because I don't want people like finding Kayla and start talking to her too much, you know, because she's a valuable person that doesn't need to be hounded on because of our mass fanhood.

12
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,619
Right.

13
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:12,919
Keeping you anonymous.

14
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,279
You ready for your profile to get the Spitball bump where you're about to go viral?

15
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:17,579
That's it.

16
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,219
It's happening.

17
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,039
You're going to get hundreds of thousands of followers because she's on Spitball.

18
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,319
Kayla, we're super excited to have you here.

19
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:38,079
Kayla has told us that before the show that she's brought us a dating idea, which is exciting because we've had dating ideas in the docket ready to go, Scott and I, so that we could do what we've wanted to do for a long time, which is tonight we are doing Oops! All Love Corners.

20
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,779
Each of us, including the game, will have some Russell's Love Corner to share.

21
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,599
So to get us started, we're going to be playing Tinder or Timber.

22
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:50,879
I want to raid for you an actual dating app and when it was founded, a little bit about it.

23
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,799
I want you to tell me if it's still around or not.

24
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,699
This is a list of really weird ones.

25
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,259
And of course, we got to start every week as we do with our guest, Kayla.

26
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,419
I want to tell you about Bristler, B-R-I-S-T-L-R.

27
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:07,539
This was a real thing started in 2014, which connects people with beards and those who

28
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,559
love beards.

29
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,119
Users sign up, create profiles, find matches based off of beard preferences.

30
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,219
The platform served its niche community.

31
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,739
But is it still around?

32
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,199
I kind of hope not.

33
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,139
So I'm going to go with no.

34
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,779
2014, it's still around today.

35
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,999
You too could be finding the bearded man of your dreams or be the bearded man of somebody else's if you go to Bristler.

36
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,379
Scott, I want to tell you about Hater.

37
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,459
Hater was on Shark Tank.

38
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,619
Hater matched people based off of mutual dislikes.

39
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,719
It offered a unique way to find compatibility through shared hatreds.

40
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,419
It was founded in 2017, but is it still around?

41
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,199
2017?

42
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,439
Yeah, I'd say that's still around then.

43
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,559
They shut down shortly after Shark Tank.

44
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:57,719
can't imagine why okay hold on i think it should open back up especially the kendrick lamar drake

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,919
everyone's becoming a hater it's literally my dating

46
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:08,239
you gotta find an alt buddy that's hilarious let's try

47
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:17,059
i was gonna call it red flags man i had a great idea all right you know what i'll pivot a little

48
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:24,439
bit off of that that's so good i'm keeping that in russell let me tell you about an app that was

49
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,719

50
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,919
sea captains with those who love the ocean providing a platform of nautical themed romance

51
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:42,199
here's the best tagline of the night users who join can quote find their first mate oh are they

52
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:49,139
still around or did they retire? This was back in 2007 that they started. They have to be around.

53
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,459
It's like sugar daddy app, but less direct, you know? Boat season. Boat season. They are still

54
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,979
around. See Captain Date. Very good. Of course it would be zero all except for Russell, the expert

55
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,799
of the love corner who's got his first point on the board. Next time through. Kayla, I want to

56

62
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,039
that seems to be squatting on the domain who's doing something over there so i think there's

63
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:02,259
still a thing that gave me the ick for sure all right scott i want to tell you about all one word

just like holy cow herpes at least at least they stopped spreading it yeah keep them in their own

72
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:59,079
little community i guess like a leper colony an online commune for herpes russell i gotta tell

73
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:05,039
you about two words awake dating awake dating catered to people who are interested in conspiracy

74
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,059
theories allowing them to have a platform for truthers to connect with each other it allows

75
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,039
users to find like-minded individuals who share their interests in alternative viewpoints and

76
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:21,299
theories founded in 2016 is it still around today awake dating there must be it's gotta be there's

77
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:27,359
too many crazy people it's still around yes sir something weird about 2016 i wonder why that was

78
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:32,699
founded then keeping them all together in the same spot like keeping them breathing in the same like

79
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:42,259
a leper colony all right all right kayla kayla i gotta tell you about vampire passions vampire

80
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,119
passions, two words spelled as it sounds, catered to vampires and vampire enthusiasts,

81
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,119
which is a bizarre way to say that.

82
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,979
Offering communication options for chats and message boards, you can connect over shared

83
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,659
interests in vampire-related books, movies, and lifestyles.

84
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:01,639
Since the early 2000s, it was founded, but is it still around?

85
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,939
Early 2000s?

86
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:03,739
Yeah, I think so.

87
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,679
Early 2000s.

88
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,619
I feel like I've heard of this.

89
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,439
I think it's still around.

90
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,819
It is still around.

91
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:08,819
Why have you heard of this?

92
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,979
Not traditionally a dating app specifically, but it's got a thing.

93
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,419
Dude, I have no idea I've heard this, but there's a community.

94
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,199
They're out there.

95
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:19,179
You're making it sound like you're trying to say that you're not a part of it.

96
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,379
There are dozens of us.

97
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,259
No, you are.

98
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:27,579
Russell, I don't need to say I'm not a part of it because it's very clear that I'm not a part of it.

99
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:28,859
I don't know what.

100
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:32,519
I like that it has both vampire enthusiasts and vampires.

101
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,259
That's pretty great.

102
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Scott, I got to tell you about Gluten-Free Singles, which provided a platform for individuals with celiac disease and gluten intolerances to meet.

103
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,659
connect it offers resources community features and a supportive environment for gluten-free

104
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:53,959
singles specifically founded in 2013 best domain name ever and absolutely that must still be it's

105
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,379
still around yeah yes sir they've got a whole dating advice column and everything growing in

106
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:06,039
numbers ever since 2013 that's right last time here's uh russell last one salad match all one

107
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,519
word developed by the just salad company salad match brought back the communal experience of

108
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,639
The Big Bowl of Salad.

109
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,579
The app connected people who hit it off while waiting in line at their restaurant.

110
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,279
This was a restaurant that saw people hitting it off and said, we got to make a dating app around this.

111
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,099
I guess you make connections off of shared love of salad bars.

112
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,339
I don't totally get it.

113
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,719
Founded in 2012.

114
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:28,199
Is it still around?

115
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,019
No, it's not.

116
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:30,759
I can't.

117
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,479
Please.

118
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,719
No, it is not.

119
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:34,259
Very good.

120
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:34,779
No, it's not.

121
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,679
Which I think is because you got all three right.

122
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,459
You got awake dating.

123
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,679
So, yeah, you got all three.

124
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:39,379
Well done, Russell.

125
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:39,839
Of course.

126
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,239
Of course.

127
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,479
Our local Love Corner expert.

128
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,059
I mean, who's bonding over salad?

129
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,699
Like, if you're on that app, I feel like everybody found each other and then that was it.

130
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,419
That was the only people on the planet.

131
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,479
Rabbits love it.

132
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,479
I define myself by my salad enthusiasm.

133
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,179
You won.

134
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,279
That means I think you got to go first this week.

135
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,559
What do you got for us this week, Russlin?

136
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,239
Okay.

137
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,479
Well, as you guys already know, my original idea was kind of taken.

138
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,359
Hater.

139
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:09,999
Okay.

140
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:17,419
by some shark tank people so i have two ideas now i don't know which one to go with all right

141
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:22,499
we're gonna put this as part of it i like this idea of the way to a man's heart is through his

142
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:29,619
stomach so taking a spin off of sizzle and then i also have red flags where you talk about red flags

143
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:33,819
and you bring up your red flags and if you don't you know i'm gonna go with red flags that's the

144
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:37,939
one i'm gonna go with go with red flags because mine's kind of sort of a little bit like what

145
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:42,979
you're talking about all right so here's the dating app idea if you can't have me at my worst

146
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:50,759
you can't have me at my best all right so the dating app is all about showing off your red flags

147
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:58,239
right telling people what makes you different and unique and is a common red flag okay or uncommon

148
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:05,319
keep you spicy keep you different and you're matching people based on their red flags not on

149
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:13,979
they're green ones sure show them at your worst okay uh that's it what are some examples of like

150
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:19,899
are you talking about like deep dark dirty uh this is a disgusting fact about me kind of stuff or like

151
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,719
where's the threshold that's tough i have trouble when they say all right we're gonna play two truths

152
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:30,219
and a lie like i don't know what to say about myself so like if i was presented with a text

153
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:35,019
box on an app that said what what are some of your red flags i don't know if i could that would

154
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:43,059
be a tough one i think it is tough i think it's important to figure out what makes you a red flag

155
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,759
what's your red flags do you guys know what your red flags are i'm sure people could tell me there

156
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,599
it is so that's where you bring that's the viral component so instead of you should i got it i got

157
00:10:53,599 --> 00:11:01,839
it you have your exes get sent to form then fill out the flags about you like you're getting endorsed

158
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,299
on linkedin god and you can't see the answers and then you just get blindly matched with someone

159
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:15,779
else yeah whoa you have been endorsed three times for talks over people are people out there like

160
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,719
vouching for their exes you know what i mean like all right you know we're breaking up i'll i'll set

161
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:25,099
up your profile like i know we're breaking up right now but like if you set up your red flags

162
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:30,399
yeah it might need to be a long time ago but i mean it would be fun to get your friends to show

163
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,939
like so do your red flags maybe maybe friends maybe not exes oh that'd be tough though like

164
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:41,399
i mean you could do the opposite you could do both red and green flags right so it's like the

165
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,319
roses and thorns you know here are your thorns here are the roses and you have your friends

166
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:52,819
fill that out for you or yourself right one good one bad what about like your beige flags where

167
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:57,299
it's like you don't know whether it's a red or green yeah you're right some people might see a

168
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,719
red flag is a green flag you know yeah or beige are there certain red flags okay kayla because

169
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:10,619
you're the resident single person right now are there red flags that you're like that ain't a red

170
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:17,519
flag that's a green one for me do you know what i mean no i want like i want examples so um guys

171
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:32,159
big into uh let's say crypto left that's a good or left i don't know like like uh like fast cars

172
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,599
like they're beat like deep in that fast car game you know it's like is that or is that like a beige

173
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:42,159
flag you know what i mean like some people might be like oh i love the fast cars yeah that's a hold

174
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:50,899
up bass that they've caught on their left left hard left with really sharp angular sunglasses

175
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,579
and backwards hat but do you know of a girl that would be interested in that like oh yeah i mean

176
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,019
like yeah like the fishing thing like country girls would be interested in that for sure

177
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:07,539
there's probably some overlap there of your red flags my green yeah or like yeah going with the

178
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:12,039
fast cars one i think i don't think it's a green flag but like a guy with a motorcycle is pretty

179
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,939
like that seems fun for a moment and some people might see that as red probably not long run yeah

180
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:23,479
yeah that's a good example a guy with a lot of tattoos some people are really into that green

181
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:30,919
oh yeah the pete davidson's of the world have been making it all right oh sorry the the mgk's the

182
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:39,239
justin peepers davidson uh yeah just stop you're behind yeah right i don't know why but everybody

183
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:44,899
who's timothy chalamet is where it's at now right not for me oh he looks like a pre-bubescent boy

184
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:54,299
i feel like after a while when you finally get your head wrapped or you get the algorithm fed

185
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:59,539
with the things that you find as red or green flags there's got to be some data science in

186
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,859
there that says if people like these three things then these five other things might trend toward

187
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:09,019
good or bad too right how do you it's like a flag sorting algorithm that you're looking to make

188
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:16,059
So you're saying like, I sign up for this dating app and I straight up put in, it gives you a list of like a hundred different things.

189
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,979
Like you said, tattoos, fast cars, pictures with bass in them.

190
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,479
And I just straight up have my dropdown and say red, green, or beige on it.

191
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:28,059
And I put that for all of them and that essentially creates my algorithm in the back.

192
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,859
And then that'll match me with...

193
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,379
Do apps have something like this already?

194
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,539
It's all about likes at this point.

195
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,979
Like what is the profile creation process like nowadays?

196
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
Okay, I think you guys were saying this.

197
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,939
What if you didn't, you had other people,

198
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,219
instead of them swiping left and just moving on,

199
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:49,739
they have to label what made them not like it.

200
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,919
And now your red flags are not generated by you,

201
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,079
but by the other people.

202
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,499
Plus you get anonymous feedback afterwards of like,

203
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,359
this is what's wrong with your profile.

204
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,619
Maybe you should update this.

205
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,639
Or hey, the second picture really turned off a lot of people for some reason.

206
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,659
Or this is what's wrong with your personality.

207
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,879
Maybe change that.

208
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,319
When you unfriend someone or block someone, you have to put a reason why.

209
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,719
That's it.

210
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,779
So when you're unmatching somebody, in order to do that, you must leave feedback.

211
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,759
Or swipe left, like Kayla said.

212
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:21,299
Yes.

213
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,159
That's really interesting.

214
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,119
And then once a month, you see all the people that you swiped right on.

215
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:32,419
And the ones that you liked and they didn't like, they tell you why.

216
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,239
Oh, my god.

217
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,439
You better have high self-esteem for that.

218
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:54,179
Yeah. It is trial by fire. It feels like you're creating like a genetic algorithm where you've got like the best of the you're creating the best profiles that the group consensus can make for each person. Then you can take that. But maybe the end goal is this is now created the perfect profile that you then take to the other side.

219
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:57,319
It's about putting your best foot forward, okay?

220
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:57,899
You know?

221
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,559
Just because you take, you know, maybe you're better on your right side than your left,

222
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,679
and you believed your, you know, right side was your better side.

223
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,679
That's what this app is about.

224
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:11,879
Could we pivot this app to not be a dating service, but a profile creation system?

225
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:12,239
Yeah.

226
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:16,979
Where it's a peer-to-peer review of all the photos and bios and stuff you're writing?

227
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,899
So there's subreddits dedicated to this.

228
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,499
Like, rate my profile and stuff.

229
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,559
And people just post and be like, what do you think of this?

230
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,219
And people will give hard, honest criticism of it.

231
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:26,879
Like roast me.

232
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,459
It's not, it's weirdly wholesome.

233
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:32,379
Like they're legitimately trying to help you

234
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,279
and not just crush your self-esteem,

235
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,179
but they're also brutally honest at the same time.

236
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,359
Yeah, don't tell Russell that

237
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,699
because he'll jump on that subreddit

238
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:40,539
and crush everyone's self-esteem.

239
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,599
I can see him thinking right now.

240
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:45,219
Yeah, he's like, let me troll after this.

241
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,979
Hey, idiot, you need more bass.

242
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,119
This should be a fiver service.

243
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,339
This has to exist, right?

244
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,459
The profile glow up.

245
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,859
That's a small ass fish.

246
00:16:52,859 --> 00:17:01,219
you know what they say about small fish the best you got i think that's cool like the negative

247
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:07,339
rating system or like the you know because i feel like people like girls swipe right or the other

248
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,259
way is right the one you like left is bad when making all the data naps i don't i've never like

249
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:19,819
used it i've only used them when like kayla's over or something i don't have when sarah's over

250
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:27,799
yeah sorry sarah that's right oh sorry sarah um yeah it's left then like then it's like instead

251
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,139
of you accumulating points you're actually putting into the system and getting people more matches

252
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:38,919
and maybe how's this too it connects to other dating apps and so now your profile that you're

253
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:47,119
making and updating connects to all the dating apps in the system bubble bubble tinder all the

254
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:54,259
ones that i know tweezer gabhart the clap one i make dating apps i don't know them

255
00:17:54,259 --> 00:18:03,619
herp day there it is see captain day sizzle vampire passion yes how big is your fish

256
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:11,499
it's a pretty small fish that's a northern pike baby oh light him up there should be a dude man

257
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:17,559
a dude app of just like dudes rating each other's fish catches just big ass fish oh that would

258
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:24,959
probably be so popular fish tinder finder just like people browsing big ass fish you know but

259
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:31,639
i did tell okay like for the viewers at home all the women that listen to this show okay dudes have

260
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:36,479
very few photos of themselves and the one time their bros take a photo of them is when they're

261
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,699
holding up a fish.

262
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,659
This is the only reason why

263
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,759
they have photos all the time on there.

264
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,659
Because there's no other time. That's a good picture of me.

265
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,439
I think I could get another 12 years out of this.

266
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,399
When are bros taking pictures of bros?

267
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,259
You know? Like, oh,

268
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,419
here's a photo. I'm going to take a snap, a picture

269
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,139
of Leo just standing

270
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,739
in front of a flag, looking cool.

271
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,839
I don't know.

272
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,419
Like a fish. Well, why can't they just take

273
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,019
the picture before they catch the fish?

274
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:03,859
Like, you're on a boat. Show that off.

275
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,559
Yeah, share your cool boat.

276
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,579
Leave the fish in the lake.

277
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,939
Bro, why were you taking a photo of me?

278
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,339
Like, I haven't even caught a fish yet.

279
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,599
Like, that's so weird.

280
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,399
That is the, that's so weird.

281
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,179
That's how it goes, Kayla.

282
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,239
That's the conversation.

283
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:22,039
I mean, and also, like, they're on a boat, so they're bending over, and their shirts are up, and their butt crack's showing.

284
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:23,599
Oh, my God.

285
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,279
I'll put that as beige flag.

286
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,479
It's a B.

287
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,559
Prefers to show ass crack.

288
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,379
Beige flag.

289
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,959
Your worst photos, just.

290
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,799
Now that's interesting.

291
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:39,239
I wonder if you could troll the Google Photos API or whatever

292
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:45,659
and pull out bad, unflattering pictures to go with your red flag thing.

293
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:48,879
If you're going to make a site about all your flaws,

294
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,299
it doesn't seem right to have a beautiful headshot.

295
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,219
You've got to have a picture of you mid-sneeze.

296
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,099
Just give it a link to your Google Photos and be like,

297
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,439
pick the worst pictures of me.

298
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,639
You have no control over it.

299
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:02,939
Uneditable, exactly.

300
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:03,859
That's tough.

301
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:04,599
Here's 10.

302
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:05,819
Pick your worst five.

303
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,499
That would be.

304
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:06,959
That's tough.

305
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,479
I feel like at that point, nobody's going to sweat.

306
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:10,439
Everybody leaves.

307
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,359
Who wants to just go on that to literally be bullied?

308
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,559
Yeah, that's probably true.

309
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:18,059
Why would you want to match with people at their worst?

310
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,719
Still better than the salad one.

311
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,759
All right, Leo, what do you got this week?

312
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:27,639
Okay.

313
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,899
Name is TBD here.

314
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:33,379
but my love corner for today is re-eating meat.

315
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,839
You note what leftovers you have in your fridge.

316
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:38,639
What did I cook this week?

317
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:41,859
I have no idea where this is going.

318
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,439
Other people have done the same,

319
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:50,819
and it uses cooking blogs and New York Times cooking recipes and stuff

320
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,279
to decide what you guys could make together.

321
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:56,739
If I have leftover chicken that I made on the grill last night,

322
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,359
and you've got tortillas that are going to go bad,

323
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:06,899
we could get together and talk over making quesadillas. Reheat and meat. That's incredible.

324
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,399
I really like making all this food, but I have some leftover. I wish I had someone to share it

325
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:17,659
with. You get a natural selection of people who like home cooking. So you're not just going to

326
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:24,919
a movie or whatever. And you can share that passion and get good meals from each other.

327
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,479
That's a first date built into the app.

328
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,739
Can I go on there if I have nothing in my fridge and I just need my next meal?

329
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,719
You just want the equivalent of couch surfing.

330
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,839
I want to eat a stranger's leftovers.

331
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:39,059
With them.

332
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,119
Swipe right.

333
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,339
And you're swiping right on both their meal proposal for the week and them.

334
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,679
As a person, of course.

335
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,559
Ooh, you got to show off.

336
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,439
I make fancy leftovers.

337
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:53,319
I have a seafood allergy, so I never see that dish that you have slash you as a person.

338
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,659
Is there anything here?

339
00:21:54,979 --> 00:22:00,319
I'm trying to spit it so it's not just food.

340
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:08,259
But I think there's something related to bringing people together over mutual needs, we'll say.

341
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,479
Mutual needs.

342
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,559
It's every dating app.

343
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:12,179
I have needs.

344
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:12,659
Needs.

345
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,979
Needs may not be the right word there.

346
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,519
I hunger.

347
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,119
Air, leftover, sex, you know.

348
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,619
Like, I'll bring the drinks, you bring the food.

349
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:25,499
Sure, sure, sure.

350
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,499
Like, or like...

351
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,239
Ooh, like a wine pairing for it.

352
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,359
I propose a meal and you have to bring a fancy wine or something.

353
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:32,759
Exactly.

354
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:33,299
Or a cocktail.

355
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,119
Yes.

356
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,039
Coffee and donuts, you know?

357
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:37,739
Totally.

358
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,119
Bread, lunch meat.

359
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:46,259
So you're going to this app with some interests and things you are and are not looking for

360
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,759
and personality things that matter to you and all that stuff, minimum.

361
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,999
But you're also going with your dietary preferences.

362
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,739
And it's matching on both of those things.

363
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,699
If you end up with this person long term, you're going to be eating a lot of meals together.

364
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,219
Maybe it's good to get on the same page about what you like from the get go, huh?

365
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:04,879
Yes.

366
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:12,179
You could turn this into like you partner with all these cooking places like a spice shop, you know?

367
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:12,619
Sure.

368
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:17,639
Like, hey, you bring something, I bring something, you know, or like, what is it?

369
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,619
The paint and pour kind of maybe mentality.

370
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,399
You go there, you're going to bring something.

371
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:25,259
I'm going to bring something and it'd be some talking point, right?

372
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:25,619
Yeah.

373
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,179
Yeah.

374
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:31,019
And then you're at this date at the cooking place.

375
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,219
So they got the spice.

376
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,639
They're selling you all that shit.

377
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:35,379
But then they stuff.

378
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:42,399
Learn how to do hibachi, but bring your own stuff, your raw ingredients that are going to go bad in two days.

379
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,059
Well, that's like a great dating app, a dating idea.

380
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,159
Like, I would love to, like, learn hibachi.

381
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,079
Yeah.

382
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,419

You're right.

Weird flex meal.

00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,638
Yeah, what would be the meal?

410
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:18,679
We have a grill that does smoking, and we make a smoked pork tenderloin that's like

411
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,919
apple juice and thyme and stuff, and it's really easy to make, but it's amazing.

412
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:25,299
You get the smoke ring and everything in just a couple hours.

413
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,479
Ooh, I want to meet you.

414
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,319
Smoked pork tenderloin.

415
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:27,959
I want to meet you.

416
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,039
That sounds amazing.

417
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,158
What would you bring that's like a flex to this app?

418
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,079
I got pork chops that I marinated, and they're amazing.

419
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,699
People talk to me about it.

420
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:38,159
They are.

421
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:38,639
Nice.

422
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,759
A week.

423
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:43,679
I marinated them for like 24 hours, and they come out hell.

424
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,259
Awesome.

425
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:44,959
So good.

426
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:45,959
Some form of pie.

427
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:46,719
Oh, yes.

428
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,059
Italian, of course.

429
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,339
Red sauce going through.

430
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:51,199
Get that going ahead of time.

431
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,739
Let it sit for like three days, and then it's all perfect.

432
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,639
Dude, Scott, with your last name of Brandon Isio,

433
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,239
somebody swiped right on you and did not get an Italian meal,

434
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,179
I think that would have just been like a slap in the face.

435
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,299
Tacos? What the hell?

436
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,419
I'm bringing tacos. I make a great

437
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,219
coconut curry.

438
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,939
Alright, Kayla, what's your

439
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,319
weird flex meal? I guess I'd say

440
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,419
either soup. I'm really good at just throwing

441
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:18,378
together whatever I have into a good soup

442
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:19,919
or stir fry. Totally.

443
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,219
The stir fry would be so great.

444
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,359
Bring all your leftovers. I was just going to say, if only

445
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,599
I had a little bit of, oh, someone on

446
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,479
reheating me. It's got

447
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,539
exactly what I need to finish this stir fry off.

448
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,419
You're literally swiping based on

449
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:33,998
their ingredients they have available.

450
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,479
I mean, maybe they look interesting enough, but you never know.

451
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:40,238
It's so superficial to look at only the people.

452
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:40,819
Their pantry.

453
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:41,398
You gotta look.

454
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:46,599
As your unsolicited wingman, Kayla, you're gonna need to bring up like cookies, apple

455
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,459
pie, generational apple pie, all right?

456
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,559
That's gonna get any man on the app to swipe on that.

457
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:54,179
Yeah.

458
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,679
That doesn't sound like my type.

459
00:27:55,939 --> 00:28:00,939
Apple pie sounds like a southerner that we do not have the same views.

460
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:02,059
See?

461
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,759
Okay, so this is really a real match then, right?

462
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:06,839
Your meal.

463
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,499
I ain't going to match with an apple pie person.

464
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,859
Like, dudes are always going to be cooking meats.

465
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,299
Unless you're Italian.

466
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:14,919
You're cooking pasta, right?

467
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,419
I like a good breakfast pizza.

468
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:17,819
This is rough.

469
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:18,939
Oh, no.

470
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:19,519
So good.

471
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,899
Oh, yeah, that's probably sacrilege to the Italian.

472
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:22,359
My bad.

473
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:22,959
My me.

474
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:23,639
That's right.

475
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,699
I'm trying to think of, like, unique, weird stuff that would make you stand out on the app.

476
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:27,639
Dude, this is better.

477
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,559
Sizzle needs to take this idea, Leo.

478
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:30,959
The Oscar Mayer app.

479
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:31,459
Yeah.

480
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:44,338
sizzle you can have this for a nominal fee very reasonable licensing you can have it for free

481
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:55,018
that's the conceit of the show all right scott i'm ready to enter scott's love corner what do

482
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:59,898
you got for me all right i like hardware and i want to do a love corner that's based on hardware

483
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:06,579
so you guys ever you ever heard of orange theory it's like a weird culty uh fitness group where

484
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:12,758
you go it's expensive and you go and they give you like a heartbeat monitor and then they display

485
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,898
everyone's heartbeat monitor up on a screen up there and everyone's working out and the whole

486
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:19,959
thing is like work as hard as you want but try to keep your heartbeat within such a range and like

487
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:26,658
interesting concept i want to do that with dating i want to make like a chemistry checking wristband

488
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:34,658
or wearable device that'll analyze like the subtle biological signals and give a compatibility score

489
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:41,398
either of yourself or something that can check for like skin temp or analyze pupil dilation or

490
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,419
even like pheromones are coming off of you at that point and then you get actual analytics at the end

491
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,518
of that yeah like whoa am i attracted this person or not and then you could have so many different

492
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:54,819
variations of that like you could have a whole like orange theory you do speed dating where

493
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:59,538
everyone has one of these bands on there and you get actual numbers by the end of like oh this

494
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:03,518
person was talking to this person and these what their levels were going or you just use it for

495
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:08,298
yourself and on a date and you can get your feeling but you can also get the metrics afterwards and

496
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:12,138
be like was i actually into that or not this is getting really dystopian really quick but they

497
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:17,938
usually do so like getting your score at the end of go-karting like oh i matched best with numbers

498
00:30:17,938 --> 00:30:24,238
three and eleven okay interesting it sounds like gattaca or something like you know what i mean a

499
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,078
A lot of these turn into Gattaca by the end.

500
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:28,978
Okay, so I'm trying to think.

501
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:31,718
So this is like biology matching.

502
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:35,378
You're still going out on normal dates and other things.

503
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,078
But I feel like this is like a thing.

504
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,258
Like types?

505
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,498
I guess it's like where you find your type, right?

506
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:42,118
I don't even know if it's types.

507
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:45,118
It's like your bodily reaction.

508
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:45,978
Yes, thank you.

509
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:46,898
Thank you.

510
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,378
I think it's interesting.

511
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:50,958
I think it'd be interesting to see those results after a date.

512
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,558
I don't know because I feel like if I went on a first date,

513
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,238
I feel like I black out a little bit afterwards.

514
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,338
It'd be nice to see the metrics of like, oh, okay.

515
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,978
My heart was like, it increased at certain points.

516
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:03,758
So it seemed like there was some sort of reaction there.

517
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,158
You're watching your heart rate at that.

518
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:06,439
You're watching your skin temp.

519
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,498
You're watching all these things.

520
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:08,299
You go on 10 dates.

521
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,338
It was like stable.

522
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:09,898
Yeah.

523
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:11,758
Maybe I was just so bored during the whole thing.

524
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:12,039
Yeah.

525
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,539
Oh, this is while you're on the date.

526
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:14,218
Yeah.

527
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:14,838
Yeah.

528
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:15,998
Do not listen.

529
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:16,878
I missed that part.

530
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:18,658
I'm curious to hear what you were thinking on this one.

531
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:22,838
I literally thought you were just wearing this monitor all day.

532
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,318
and then you were just like, alright,

533
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,658
it's gonna match you with random people.

534
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:29,278
No, no, no, you are

535
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,658
on a date at this point and you

536
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:33,598
are recording the whole,

537
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:35,878
data logging the whole time. It's quantifying speed

538
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,938
data, you dork. Okay, I don't

539
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,858
know where I was gonna Spitball with this

540
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,018
because I was like, I was like, holy

541
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,558
cow. That's tough.

542
00:31:44,518 --> 00:31:45,578
You guys are killing me.

543
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,738
I was so confused.

544
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:49,558
Tell us more about the random lady at the bank.

545
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:51,058
I can stop sweating.

546
00:31:51,058 --> 00:32:00,258
please can i add something to this all right so it is also recording and transcribing so that you

547
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:06,638
get the topics and cadences and things like that that you are interested in to try to put okay

548
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,078
numbers around that i need a second that would be kind of that would be interesting to have a whole

549
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:15,758
transcript of your date because kayla you were talking about i you know i kind of black out

550
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:21,638
during that like so if my heart rate peaked at 631 like what was even happening during that point of

551
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,338
the date hmm where we was there something that was like triggering that how do you how do you

552
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:30,318
capture the thing that's actually the moment maybe instead of transcripting the whole day it does

553
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:35,438
snapshots of like when there's like some sort of oh an event or shift your heart rate spiked at

554
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:38,818
this point i don't think totally yeah i don't think i want to see the whole transcripts then

555
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:43,898
you're going to go back and be like why did i ever say that at the same time though i would

556
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:49,958
I absolutely love to know what the first date was, like what we talked about and whatnot, like with my with my wife right now.

557
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,778
Like, what was our first date going through?

558
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:56,198
Would you have used a device to quantify and speed date?

559
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,738
I mean, I don't even know when Carrie and I's first date was.

560
00:32:58,958 --> 00:32:59,598
Like, not.

561
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,038
We were like friends.

562
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:01,858
Oh, that's a good point.

563
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,378
You guys have been dating a long time.

564
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:05,798
I got out of the friend zone, y'all, though.

565
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:06,378
So, like.

566
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:08,918
There's hope for you yet.

567
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:11,518
Because that's who's watching or listening to our show right now.

568
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:22,998
But I think that is like super cool because it would be just like you can see let's say you have like three first dates and you could look at your metrics and you could be like, wow, I think I actually really like that person.

569
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:27,358
I can see my metrics do this, but like this person I'm not sure of.

570
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:31,918
And I can tell literally because of my biology, like my physiology during that date.

571
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:32,558
Like, hmm.

572
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:37,038
I think the magic in this is the algorithm knows all of the metrics for everybody.

573
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,218
So if it sees this person was really interested in the other one, was it?

574
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:41,118
It doesn't show anyone.

575
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:46,818
it's only hey sorry thanks for coming you didn't really get any good matches this one or actually

576
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:51,098
there was something back and you have compatibility on both sides at the end of the night it only

577
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:56,278
shows when there's a match you know yeah and maybe even like let's say the other side of the date

578
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:02,118
wasn't having a great time maybe you just gotta but you did like maybe you gotta like your follow-up

579
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:08,418
game's gotta be fire yeah like it generates the points that the other person was most interested

580
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:14,478
and all that stuff and it only sends the other party each other's data this person was super

581
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:19,458
interested when you talked about this thing this person was less interested when you reached over

582
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:25,038
and touched their hand or whatever it was it's giving you the feedback from their wristband and

583
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:31,398
vice versa how do you make yourself a better person to date that's a whole nother app in itself

584
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:37,738
i know i was just thinking that too yeah that's rough we're back to the last one with the um the

585
00:34:37,738 --> 00:34:42,338
app to make your profile better i guess this is the first hardware accessory from that company

586
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:45,658
could you apply that to anything else besides first dates like i feel like that's just like

587
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:50,578
interesting like interviews i i mean i know this is the love corner episode but i feel like that's

588
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:55,238
really cool for like interviews and other aspects of life so that way you don't just buy it for

589
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:59,718
dating you can use it for other things what excites you in general you tend to be stressed

590
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:05,038
out when people talk about this general yeah yeah you're you're one-on-one with this guy

591
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:08,518
every Tuesday at like three, you're like, oh God.

592
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:10,198
It's taking years off your life, man.

593
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:11,399
Straight up.

594
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:14,078
It goes better when you avoid these topics, right?

595
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,298
Yeah.

596
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:16,099
I think we talked a little bit about this,

597
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,838
but Amazon tried something kind of like this

598
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:18,958
with the Amazon Halo.

599
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,659
It was a Fitbit-like tracker,

600
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,178
but it would say things like,

601
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:25,119
hey, you sounded like you were using an angry tone there.

602
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:26,899
Maybe tone it down kind of stuff

603
00:35:26,899 --> 00:35:29,078
to like give you a little bit of feedback about yourself.

604
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:31,018
It was very quickly discontinued.

605
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,698
People did not like that.

606
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,918
The robots telling me to be nicer.

607
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:41,178
uh nope that goes to the trash so you gotta go to the warehouse the dump where all those are

608
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:46,698
sitting unused and buy them and flash your firmware on there that's sending all of its

609
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:52,338
data to the centralized speed dating service this wouldn't be hard hardware to make all the sensors

610
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:56,678
are already out there heart rate throw it on the apple watch bang make an app of thermistors yeah

611
00:35:56,678 --> 00:36:01,478
that's what that's what i'm gonna say like sell it to apple boom there you go put it on the app store

612
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,438
Or just make it an app with existing.

613
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,099
Everyone who goes to the event has to have one.

614
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,118
Or make a headband, you know?

615
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:10,898
So like when you're on your first date, you're wearing a giant red headband that's tracking.

616
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,099
Blinking lights.

617
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:13,658
Spinning thing on top.

618
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,678
Shooting sparks.

619
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:15,958
A Google car.

620
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:19,498
No one is allowed to be confident here.

621
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:21,058
I was really stressed out all night.

622
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,018
I wonder why my confidence wasn't high.

623
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:25,418
I had that ridiculous pinwheel hat on.

624
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:26,078
Yeah.

625
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:29,938
Can you quantify love?

626
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:31,099
That's a dumb question.

627
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:36,618
dumb way to ask that but like is this possible i guess there's like the stress response and stuff

628
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:41,818
when pheromone sniffer do humans put off much pheromones i don't know much about that i'm all

629
00:36:41,818 --> 00:36:45,998
about trying to make technology to smell they were didn't ever talk about this the smell tech

630
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:50,018
there's a whole thing around that there's an industry around artificial noses to detect like

631
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:55,438
presence of chemicals and stuff in the air that's right ai will never beat our noses that's what

632
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:57,198
That's what it is, guys.

633
00:36:57,198 --> 00:37:01,738
As long as we got our nose, AI will never take us over.

634
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:07,298
The only thing that we can't do better than chat GPT is smell the roses.

635
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:08,318
Collect that data.

636
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:09,098
That's poetry right there.

637
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,618
AI it, all right?

638
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:12,118
Smell this.

639
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:20,178
All right, Kayla, what love corner idea have you brought us this week?

640
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:24,238
Okay, so mine's a build off of Russell's friend of a friend idea, I think.

641
00:37:24,398 --> 00:37:25,038
Episode two.

642
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:25,298
Classic.

643
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:48,198
So like that. Yeah. So backstory. I personally think ideally I'd meet someone through a mutual friend. And so there's also I've seen apps where the only way like certain people can get on the app because like dating now is just scary. There's like scary people out there. So the only way people can get on the apps is with endorsements. Like someone saying, oh, they're like a good person, blah, blah, blah, which I get. You can lie, whatever.

644
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:50,698
But I want to mix those two together.

645
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:56,378
And the app is you download either your contacts or your social media friends to the app.

646
00:37:56,478 --> 00:38:01,878
And then you can see like their mutuals and see like who's out there like through your mutual friends.

647
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:08,358
And then if you like someone, your mutual, you can like hit them up through the app if they're on there or outside the app.

648
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:11,098
And like, see, do you think this is a match or something like that?

649
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,958
So like kind of get an endorsement with the mutual friend.

650
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:15,958
Just create LinkedIn dating.

651
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:17,158
I guess kind of.

652
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:21,978
Facebook announced Facebook dating a while back, and that was more or less their pitch.

653
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,418
They already know the social graph.

654
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:25,558
They know who's friends of friends of people and stuff.

655
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,258
Like, they can have a really good insight into that, and then it never really went anywhere.

656
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:30,698
And I always was perplexed by that.

657
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:35,938
It seems like a natural fit for Facebook or somebody else like that who's already built the who's connected with who stuff.

658
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,578
Do they do endorsements, though?

659
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:41,338
Like, I feel like somebody becomes more appealing.

660
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:48,818
Like somebody that like, wow, they have like 400 endorsements, but they look ugly AF.

661
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:52,078
But like, like maybe I should read their profile.

662
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:53,818
Like all of a sudden, right?

663
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:58,078
I just even mean like Russell, let's say you had a friend that I was like, oh, I find him cute.

664
00:38:58,078 --> 00:39:01,158
And you're like, well, also, I think your personalities mesh.

665
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:03,138
Like I do think this is a good match.

666
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:04,138
Yes.

667
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:08,398
So you're starting by finding the people who are friends of friends.

668
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:17,398
And then before contact is initiated, you somehow get the friend who you are a friend of a friend through to like review that idea.

669
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:17,878
Yeah.

670
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:21,078
And I feel like that adds just like a safety layer for like.

671
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:21,678
That's awesome.

672
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:22,478
Oh, huge.

673
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,398
I would do that all day.

674
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:24,738
Yeah.

675
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:25,438
Approve.

676
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:26,018
Deny.

677
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:26,658
Approve.

678
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,018
Yeah.

679
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:27,818
You definitely would.

680
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:35,378
But I also thought it's like it expands it because I feel like your friend group, like just like even in Holland, you have only so much so many friends in Holland.

681
00:39:35,598 --> 00:39:41,358
Then I have friends in Chicago who know way more people than I would never meet normally in person.

682
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:45,298
This is a way to broaden it, but still within the friends.

683
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:48,178
Dude, you meet a friend and you're like, hey.

684
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:50,538
You have a friend that you haven't seen in a while.

685
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:53,058
It's like, do you want to just share your contacts with me real quick?

686
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,058
Or connect?

687
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:58,038
And then you can talk about also all their single friends.

688
00:39:58,218 --> 00:40:01,438
When they start talking to you about all your single friends.

689
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:04,158
Like, oh, I know so many people that would love to date you.

690
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,518
And then you do the sync thing.

691
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,678
And now you're talking about all your friends together.

692
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:15,838
And now whether or not you like them or not, it's just a great conversation for friend groups to talk about all these single people.

693
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:18,798
And so the conversation is cool.

694
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:19,298
Yeah.

695
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:22,398
Or like, I don't think this person's good, but maybe this person's good.

696
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:22,958
Yes.

697
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:31,558
If I could install an app and every once in a while it gets a push notification that says, hey, your friend that you're close with wants to know what you think about this other friend.

698
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:33,578
Give commentary about that connection.

699
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:34,998
That would be so fun.

700
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,658
How well would these two go together?

701
00:40:36,798 --> 00:40:38,678
I would call up both people and do the same thing.

702
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:41,018
Well, sometimes it's not a good match though, right?

703
00:40:41,298 --> 00:40:44,038
Are you just blindly matching everybody who asks?

704
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:45,838
Russell would be like, yep, yep, yep, this is great.

705
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:53,878
Actually, now that I think about it, the single guys that I know and the single girls that I know, I'm like, why none of them are compatible with each other?

706
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:55,418
Yeah, okay, good.

707
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,958
I think it'd be cool to see like all the endorsements from all those people.

708
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:08,798
And like even like friends of friends could endorse like I met this guy one time or hell, even exes be like, I'm an ex.

709
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,038
I endorse this person.

710
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:14,838
There are some people that are very big advocates of their exes to go find their next person.

711
00:41:15,198 --> 00:41:16,978
And that's a huge green flag.

712
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:17,558
Right.

713
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:22,838
Like and also the person that wants to see that person's ex is like all in.

714
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:25,658
Like, let me see that person and who they are.

715
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:26,018
Probably.

716
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:26,298
Right.

717
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:29,198
The fact that they're endorsing him is either as a red flag or a green flag.

718
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:29,558
Right.

719
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:30,058
So it's like.

720
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:31,418
Yeah, it's like a beige, you know?

721
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:33,338
It's a beige, for sure.

722
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:35,358
Yeah.

723
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,098
I've said this before in the show, Kayla,

724
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,518
but my very first date with my wife

725
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:41,898
was crashed by a mutual friend

726
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,678
that we just happened to both be walking

727
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:45,098
downtown on 8th Street,

728
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:46,158
and we both saw him.

729
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:46,898
We're like, hey, Carl.

730
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:48,118
She goes, hey, Carl.

731
00:41:48,218 --> 00:41:49,398
We go, how do you know Carl?

732
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,438
And then Carl came and crashed with us at the date,

733
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:53,678
and it was awesome,

734
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,338
because he's like, I know this person.

735
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:55,758
He's great.

736
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:56,498
I know this person.

737
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:57,478
He's not a serial killer.

738
00:41:57,858 --> 00:41:58,918
You guys are great for each other.

739
00:41:59,278 --> 00:41:59,598
That was it.

740
00:41:59,598 --> 00:41:59,838
There you go.

741
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:01,738
Real life endorsement stamped on our forehead.

742
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:02,918
Real life scenario of the app.

743
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:03,998
I want this one.

744
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,898
This is the one I want to exist.

745
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,478
This is so much easier.

746
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:09,378
This is like the easier version of friend of a friend.

747
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,418
This was built for you, Russell.

748
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:10,938
Right?

749
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:13,578
I think I built off of it a little bit.

750
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:14,578
It made it a little bit better.

751
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,678
Way better because mine was like pictures of your friends.

752
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:18,298
I don't know.

753
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:18,778
It just felt.

754
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,498
Yeah, yours was like kind of weird.

755
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,618
Yours was just truly pimping people out.

756
00:42:22,698 --> 00:42:25,498
And I don't think you were going to ever find someone to match.

757
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,118
That's why I didn't ever do it.

758
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,518
It just felt a little awkward at that point.

759
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:31,158
You know?

760
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:31,758
Sure.

761
00:42:32,138 --> 00:42:33,198
This is way easier.

762
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,558
Also, you did it on Facebook.

763
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,638
You did a Facebook group, just posting your friends' pictures.

764
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:40,978
Please snatch this one up.

765
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:44,218
Porch pickup or delivery.

766
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:45,518
Oh my God.

767
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,518
Listen, that's so true.

768
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:53,098
It's like Facebook Marketplace, but for your single friends.

769
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:53,758
Oh boy.

770
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:54,078
Oh.

771
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:54,698
Yeah.

772
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:56,458
That's funny.

773
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:56,778
It was.

774
00:42:56,938 --> 00:42:58,578
That's definitely where it went.

775
00:42:58,798 --> 00:42:59,618
And how did it go?

776
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:00,658
It didn't go.

777
00:43:01,598 --> 00:43:03,358
Nowhere, because it just felt wrong.

778
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:09,438
After you build the Facebook group and you try to invite people to it, you're like, is this a swinger group?

779
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:10,998
At first glance.

780
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:12,038
Come look at the menu.

781
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:13,878
Yeah, come look.

782
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,638
But you know what?

783
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:17,838
These women are yours for the taking.

784
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:25,538
It gets really weird when you're a married dude and you're trying to take pictures with your single friends.

785
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,618
I'm like, you know what?

786
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:28,498
This ain't for me.

787
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:30,378
The vibes were not right.

788
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:33,318
The intention nice, vibes bad.

789
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:35,038
Just so bad.

790
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,018
Did it get big?

791
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:41,498
No, I did not invite anybody because I'm like, this turns weird quick.

792
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:42,258
Sure.

793
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:43,718
But I like this endorsement.

794
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:48,058
Yeah, because each person coming to this theoretical app, Friend of a Friend 2.0,

795
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:50,978
they're coming to it consensually.

796
00:43:51,258 --> 00:43:52,538
They're wanting to be there.

797
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:54,398
This is something that they haven't been put up to.

798
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,838
And then they're seeking the endorsements of their friend, Gref.

799
00:43:57,198 --> 00:44:06,458
If you specify in the app you are interested in this gender, is that the only gender that's allowed to comment on and endorse?

800
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,278
Oh, otherwise it's just a bunch of wingmen.

801
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:10,698
Seeking women only.

802
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,718
So only women are allowed to say.

803
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:13,558
Right.

804
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:14,618
That's what I'm worried about.

805
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:14,818
I don't think so.

806
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,998
Is you have these 10 bros who are all endorsing each other.

807
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:17,238
No?

808
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:23,638
But that's like, yeah, that's on you to take that as a grain of salt if it's all the guy friends or not.

809
00:44:23,638 --> 00:44:26,538
Can you tell? I guess, yeah, it's a UI problem at that point.

810
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:26,858
Yeah.

811
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,598
In your app, make sure it's obvious.

812
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:32,138
Kevin and Mike have only ever endorsed each other.

813
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:35,198
Yeah. I think it should say who endorsed you, so you can be like,

814
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,218
oh, okay, let me hit that person up and learn more if I need to learn more.

815
00:44:38,418 --> 00:44:41,438
Yeah. Or like, what if you showed the relationship so it's like,

816
00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:46,178
oh, his mom, his sister, his mom says he's a special little boy.

817
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,478
He's a nice young man.

818
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:58,438
i like the idea that you can't directly contact the other party until at least x percent of all

819
00:44:58,438 --> 00:45:02,898
of the mutual friends between the two of you on the graph have signed off on it that's fun

820
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:08,598
oh that's interesting there's a bunch of people that you could swipe right on okay great now who

821
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:13,678
are out of these four people who know that person what are the two that you want to ask for their

822
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:20,398
blessing you know but maybe like that just motivates them to see each other maybe that's it

823
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:22,518
You know how like, okay, this is a pivot.

824
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:28,118
The parents when like, no, you're never allowed to see that boy ever again.

825
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:31,698
And it just makes the girl just like, no, I'm doing this to spite you.

826
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:37,338
My friend says that I always date trash men and she keeps rejecting them in the app.

827
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,138
But that just makes me want to.

828
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:42,098
Yeah, they've got Brita syndrome community.

829
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,058
Yes.

830
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:45,538
All right, Kayla, would you sign up for your own app?

831
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,538
Yeah, potentially, I guess.

832
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:49,618
What's the name of it?

833
00:45:49,618 --> 00:45:50,558
I don't have a name.

834
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:51,838
I have no name for it.

835
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:53,878
It's just going to be bought by LinkedIn in the first year.

836
00:45:54,158 --> 00:45:55,658
Endorsement of friends.

837
00:45:56,458 --> 00:46:01,678
Dude, you know what's interesting is maybe I'd make more friends or try to get their contact,

838
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:06,518
like my casual acquaintances' contact information more often because I'm like,

839
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:10,218
oh, I need to get this on my profile for my friends.

840
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:12,878
My mutual friend connect, right?

841
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,178
Mutually assured connection.

842
00:46:16,638 --> 00:46:18,558
That's the name of the app, MAC.

843
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:26,198
too long needs to be more web 2.0 it can just be like mutuals or like something mutuals yeah i do

844
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:31,158
think it gets very viral very quick quickly though because like your mutuals like it just

845
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:36,138
everybody wants to download it to share to their other friend and their other friend it just

846
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:41,798
quickly catches all of the people that could use this app there's a way bigger market than just

847
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:47,878
people who are single and looking for love you could have the like i could have this app and be

848
00:46:47,878 --> 00:46:49,638
approving all the connections for others.

849
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:51,398
And that would be just as fun or more so.

850
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:51,938
