1
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:11,703


2
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,878
<i> In the late part of the 18th century, </ i>

3
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:24,383
<i>the peasants of old California
were oppressed by tyrannical landowners. </ i>

4
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:27,119
<i>To protect the poor
and downtrodden people </ i>

5
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,021
<i> there emerged a mysterious
swordsman</ i>

6
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,890
<i> who pledged his life in
the service of justice. </ i>

7
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:36,228
<i> To the people he was a great hero
who would live forever in their hearts.</ i>

8
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:40,565
<i>To the landowners, however,
he was a real pain in the ass. </ i>

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,037
<i>He was known only as:</ i>

10
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:46,038
<i> "Zorro" </ i>

11
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:33,572
My darling, Diego.
I adore you!

12
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:37,976
No my sweet love,
I adore you.

13
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:43,915
Tell me the truth:
Do you think I'm a good wife?

14
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:49,087
You are like the Maja that
was painted by the great Goya.

15
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:52,691
But more exciting,
and bien sensual.

16
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,028
Then why doesn't my husband
ever say that?

17
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,936
Because he's not intelligent.

18
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:04,537
He is not intuitive,
he is not insightful.

19
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,773
And - he is not
in Barcelona!

20
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,012
García!

21
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,613
I am astonished that you would
enter house without my permission!

22
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,381
I might say the same thing
about you and my wife.

23
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,290
Calm yourself, my good García!

24
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:27,528
Don't want to dispute you -

25
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,529
but you are a man of some years

26
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:32,464
and, alas, no longer
in fighting shape.

27
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,904
Whereas I am a
perfect example of

28
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:39,505
a Spanish nobleman,
in his prime!

29
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,973
It is hardly a fair match.

30
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,476
I do not wish to insult you,
my dear García.

31
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,445
But I could fight four men
as fast as you!

32
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:50,816
You're right Don Diego.
You see?

33
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,485
That is why I brought
my five brothers!

34
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:59,558
And I ... I say,
ah, four?

35
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,661
What an arrogant braggart I am!

36
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,329
Why we don't do this right?

37
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:07,165
Make an appointment, find
a convenient spot?

38
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,503
I beg of you gentlemen
to desist!

39
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:15,974
Or I will be forced to call
Paco, my terrible, mute servant!

40
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,010
Paco, at last!

41
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,180
A letter? Do you really
think this is the time?

42
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,849
Well, read it to me!

43
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,853
Diego ...

44
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:26,854
my ...

45
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,055
son,

46
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,056
Come...

47
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,190


48
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,291
Home! Father wishes
me to return!

49
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:34,126
I can dally with
you no longer!

50
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,493
Get me to the coach!

51
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,702
Adios, mi amor.

52
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:46,371
Take care of yourself, eh?

53
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:04,723
Where to, señor?

54
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,559
Los Angeles. California.
Make it quick!

55
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:33,085
Los Angeles,
California.

56
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,254
The birthplace...of me.

57
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,259
After twenty years you would have thought
someone would come to the docks to meet me.

58
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:45,597
Not asking for a brass band,
but at least one mariachi player.

59
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,634
Don Diego, my old friend.

60
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,304
Esteban, my boyhood amigo!

61
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,975
It is Captain Esteban...

62
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:33,311
Captain!
I congratulate you!

63
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:43,989
Esteban!
What the hell is going on here?

64
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,160
You remember Don Diego?

65
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:52,998
Diego! Ah! Oooh!
Diego! Diego! Diego!

66
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,667
You, of course, remember
Florinda.

67
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,169
For whom we competed
as boys.

68
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,005
Of course he does...

69
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:02,040
I cannot believe it!

70
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:04,750
The little bud was promising...

71
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,537
The full flower is a rare
and wondrous dazzlement.

72
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:12,184
The full flower is
now my wife.

73
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:17,522
So, our long rivalry for
her hand is over, huh?.

74
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,858
Again, I congratulate you!

75
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,693
No, this time, I
congratulate you.

76
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:27,199
As you can see, we
haven't changed, Diego.

77
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,038
But that's what happens to people when they
stay in the same small, dull village.

78
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,787
They don't grow, they don't learn,
It's the same boring routine

79
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,732
day after day...

80
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,716
Year in, Year out...until finally
they stagnate and fester, and ...

81
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:43,717
Rot!

82
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:48,053
Well, it's certaintly good
to be home again!

83
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:55,727
That is my servant, Paco.
He is mute. He cannot speak.

84
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,263
Oh, excellent!. Perhaps he can
give lessons to my wife.

85
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:03,201
Oh! Diego. I'm so glad you're back
even under the circumstances.

86
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,803
What circumstances?

87
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,740
All I know is that my father
instructed me to return.

88
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,810
And now I find that my dear friend
has taken his place as the mayor.

89
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,081
No, no, no, lifelong amigo.
I'm only acting as the mayor.

90
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,551
Your father ...

91
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:20,952
I'm sorry to say ...
had a terrible accident.

92
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:21,753
Accident?

93
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,989
Yes.  He was out riding
when his horse

94
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,757
was frightened by a turtle.

95
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:27,826
- A turtle!
- Yes!

96
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:32,764
The horse reared. Your father was
thrown and died soon after.

97
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,766
- Pardon me, I must go.
- Yes!

98
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,435
My friend.

99
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,304
I want you to know that the turtle
that caused this has been executed.

100
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:42,007
It has been very nice
talking to you.

101
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,848
Don't you think he knows that's not the
truth about the turtle...

102
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,783
Out of my way!

103
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,976
Gentlemen!
I believe you all know each other?

104
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:23,315
- Don Diego from San Fernando.
- Don Francisco from San José.

105
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:28,153
- Don Fernando from San Diego.
- Don José from San Bernardino.

106
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,656
Luis Obispo from Bakersfield.

107
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:36,995
Now I believe, gentlemen, with no
disrespect to yourselves,

108
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:41,833
that the next mayor should be
a man of the people.

109
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,170
Someone who understands their
special needs.

110
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:52,077
That man was 3 pesos short
in paying his taxes.

111
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:56,014
I can assure you that
he will never be short again.

112
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,483
Are there any nominations?

113
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,486
- I nominate Captain Esteban!
- Oh No! No! No!

114
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,755
- I second the nomination!
- No, not me!

115
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,491
- I move to nominate Mr. Bishop.
- I, as mayor ...

116
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:07,926
I second the motion!

117
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:10,929
Moved and seconded,
the nominations are now closed.

118
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,164
Long Live Mayor Esteban!

119
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:23,842
Don Diego. I must
tell you from my heart

120
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,510
This comes as a
complete shock.

121
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,081
The people are assembled
 for your inauguration...

122
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,482
Excellency.

123
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:38,757
My fellow Los Angelinos!

124
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:48,400
Today ... we begin ... a glorious
new chapter in our illustrious history.

125
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,208
Like all achievements,

126
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,609
it will require hard work
and sacrifice.

127
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:09,921
I plan to model my government
after the Princes of India.

128
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,592
who each month, are
seated on a scale

129
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,095
and then given their
weight in gold...by the people.

130
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,432
Do you mean that you wish
your weight in gold?

131
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:24,269
No, no, no ... Not my weight...
his weight in gold.

132
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,940
But, Mr. Mayor, already our taxes
are almost what we earn.

133
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,909
How can we pay you more than that?

134
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:34,746
- It will leave us with nothing!
- Less than nothing!

135
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,115
I do not make these laws!

136
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,785
You know that I am
one of you!

137
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,121
I am the from people!

138
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,458
Then you too can rebel!

139
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,791
Stand up! and spit in the

140
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:54,323
face of the wind of tyranny!

141
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,967
Who is this woman here, huh?

142
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,636
I do not believe she is one
of our people.

143
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,971
Ah, thank you very much...
that's very helpful to me.

144
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,644
The thirteen colonies have long won...
their independance from England.

145
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,814
Let their example
inspire you!

146
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,784
Now is the time to end
your domination.

147
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,319
I heard that!

148
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:18,323
Garrison!
Arrest that woman now!

149
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,593
No, wait!

150
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:23,694
Isn't this the village plaza,
where according to law...

151
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,331
Everyone is allowed to speak
his or her mind.

152
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:28,333
You are right, señorita.

153
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:33,171
The woman is allowed to speak!

154
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,840
But arrest anyone who listens.

155
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,549
March!

156
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:45,984
It is late.
Go home my children!

157
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,353
You have heard enough idiots
speak today!

158
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,522
Let your voices be heard!

159
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,292
Oppose the greedy bloodsuckers!

160
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:04,703
Thank you.

161
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:07,205
I'm Charlotte Taylor Wilson.

162
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,708
I'm with the People's
Independence Committee.

163
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,110
Don Diego de La Vega.

164
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,214
I'm with the...
greedy bloodsuckers.

165
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,550
You may joke about it,
Mr. Vega

166
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,720
But a new wind is blowing
across this land...

167
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:25,891
It is the wind of independence,
and it carries aloft

168
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:30,696
the bird of freedom, which will drop
the eggs of democracy on your head!

169
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,532
I've never heard it put that way before.

170
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,635
But we have no need
for democratic eggs in California!

171
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:40,238
The people are quite happy working
the land for the landowners.

172
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,541
You don't really believe
the people are happy!

173
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,875
All I know is, the soldiers are

174
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:46,645
are very happy shooting the people who say
that the people are not happy.

175
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:49,915
Why, we can continue this
amusing little conversation

176
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:51,519
over a private drink...here

177
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,620
where it's nice and quiet -

178
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:57,155
Or, uh...outside where it is
nice and noisy.

179
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:59,324
I'm afraid we have
nothing in common.

180
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:00,425
I'll drink to that...

181
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:02,996
Paco, why you don't bring a drink
to the lady...

182
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
Show her some manners!

183
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:07,766
Oh, thank you.

184
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:15,273
Could you tell me where I
might find a decent Inn?

185
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:16,908
An Inn??!

186
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:20,445
With all your talk about the people
I see you like decent Inns!

187
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,949
And you wear expensive clothes...
not rags.

188
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,619
And you smell of exotic perfumes,
not sheep oil.

189
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,454
Ship oil??

190
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:32,958
You mean the oil from boats?

191
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,627
No, sheep oil...from the
sheeps in the field.

192
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,797
What ships in the field?

193
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:41,633
You have never heard of the
sheeps in the field?

194
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,136
the little "Ba-ba-ba's"?

195
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,304
Ohhh!  You mean sheep!

196
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,475
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No you said Ship!

197
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:54,813
Forgive me... But you
have a very pronounced accent.

198
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:59,985
You are trying to change the subject from
the fact that you are actually...
very wealthy.

199
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:03,121
I am not!!...
very wealthy!!

200
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,624
After all... What poor woman
can afford three names?

201
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:10,829
Answer me that if you can...
Señorita Charlotte ... Taylor ... Wilson.

202
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:14,499
I have a small inheritance.

203
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:19,171
But it occurred to me that I
must do something with my life.

204
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,845
Not merely to pose,
and preen ...

205
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,246
Like a pathetic peacock!

206
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,016
If there is no inn,
is there a mission, perhaps?

207
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:34,686
A church?
Fine!

208
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:43,695
Im glad you think you are
being so helpful, but

209
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:48,633
but telling people that they have an accent
when they do not have an accent

210
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,214
You see, Paco.

211
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:08,720
This señorita Charlotte Taylor Wilson
has piqued my curiosity.

212
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:12,891
Oh, I know I have said it before...
about Emilita Dupree.

213
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,063
and... María González ...
and the three Sanchez sisters.

214
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,435
But this woman is different.

215
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,836
She has charm...
she has spirit.

216
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:27,305
and. .. fire!, Yes...fire.
That's very good.

217
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,574
Come in, come in!

218
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:35,817
Your father's fencing dummy...

219
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:39,118
and this just arrived for you.

220
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:41,919
Ooooh, poor Consuelo, you didn't
have to come up all those stairs

221
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:42,954
and carry that to me...

222
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,689
Let me take it.

223
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,260
Where do you want this?

224
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,429
Oh, anywhere is fine.

225
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:52,597
By the window!

226
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,770
Who would be writing me a letter?
Huh??

227
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:02,240
Unless my nose
for perfumes has badly betrayed me -

228
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,010
Consuelo, por favor, please.
By the chest of drawers.

229
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,780
None other than
Señorita Charlotte Taylor Wilson!

230
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,683
Paco, please.  You read it to me,
Huh?

231
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:18,290
Consuelo, por favor
in the corner, Gracias.

232
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,961
Is Esteban!,
What do you want?

233
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,036
A Masked Ball ...

234
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,037
to celebrate ...

235
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,638
His election as mayor!
Yes!

236
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:33,305
A festival!
What am I going to wear?

237
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:39,144
A,
a bullfighter, perhaps.

238
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,986
Your father told me to bring that
to you after he died.

239
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:49,821
A samurai, perhaps!

240
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:54,659
He did die?
Didn't he?

241
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I see...A gypsy fortune teller!

242
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:03,502
Your father said you would
know what to do with it.

243
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,671
A Flamingo dancer!

244
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:09,341
Something about your destiny...

245
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:11,009
Destiny?

246
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:14,346
My destiny!

247
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:16,848
Paco, open it up.

248
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:25,526
A sword ... this cape.
And a hat!

249
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,527
What can it mean?

250
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:36,528
1,000 PESOS REWARD FOR INFORMATION
LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF Zorro.

251
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:48,714
TO MY SON

252
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,882
<i> My dear son, </ i>

253
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,787
<i>I do not call you by name </ i>

254
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,089
<i> because I do not know which
of you two brothers </ i>

255
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,990
<i> will be around to read this. </ i>

256
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:03,061
<i> But whoever does,
inherits the greatest gift I possess. </ i>

257
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,898
<i> This sword, with which
to fight injustice. </ i>

258
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:11,573
<i> this mask with which
to deceive tyranny, </ i>

259
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:15,174
<i> and this hat, which needs
repairing. </ i>

260
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,742
<i> Wear them with honor. </ i>

261
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,048
<i> For in time of need, </ i>

262
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,749
<i> it is the destiny of the Vega men
to become.... </ i>

263
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:25,250
<i><b>Zorro</b></ i>

264
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:40,932
It's a perfect costume to wear
to the ball of a tyrant.

265
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,101
Do not you think so, Paco?

266
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:47,105
Paco!

267
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,113
What are you supposed to be...?
A duck?!

268
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,951
A bear!

269
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,455
Don't be silly, bears
don't have ears like that?.

270
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:08,460
I will allow you...
that you are a pig

271
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:10,796
but it is a suprise overall....
that's all...

272
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:20,439
Seen from the back, fair enough.
You, you look like a bear.

273
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,709
Come on, come on,
little bear.

274
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,710
Come one...we
gonna be late to the party.

275
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,980
There gonna meet all kinds
of people there...

276
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,417
Chickens, dogs. Maybe another bear...

277
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,863
Please! I beg of you!

278
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,064
Leave us something!

279
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,665
Out of my way, old man.

280
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:49,500
Or I'll leave you with the Mayor's
boot print!

281
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:53,772
You know, Paco.

282
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,741
I don't feel too good about wearing
this costume

283
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:58,210
before any real acts of tyranny
or injustice.

284
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,945
It's like asking for trouble!

285
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,048
<i> Help! Please!
Somebody help us </ i>

286
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,683
<i> Help us!</ i>

287
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:07,019
<i>Please! Somebody help us! </ i>

288
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,960
- What's the problem, my friend?
- He took everything we had.

289
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:16,729
Bandito!

290
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,532
The moment has come!
My destiny calls!

291
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,201
- Was he alone?
- Yes, sir.

292
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:25,037
Come on....
Come on, Paco!

293
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:19,024
You will die,
four eye'd coyote.

294
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,394
I am prolonging it too, my friend
because I can see you need the practice.

295
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,704
Ahh..for mercy señor!  I beg your mercy!

296
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,274
from...from your flashing blade...and

297
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:37,412
Oooh!
Oooh, my God!

298
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:41,113
and from your hid...hideous dog!

299
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,083
This is the second time today that I have
heard a cry for mercy.

300
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:49,388
The first was an old man
and his little granddaughter.

301
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:52,791
I meant them no harm, señor.
Please! Spare me.

302
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,627
Yes!
Yes, I will spare you.

303
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,463
But only so you can...
spread the word

304
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,133
to all the robbers,
and the lawbreakers

305
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,935
that a new bandit
rides the lands.

306
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:07,706
A bandit for the oppressed...
and the trodden down...

307
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,975
A bandit to be known as ...

308
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,650
Has not struck
terror in your heart?

309
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:25,090
No señor.
But I'm new to the region.

310
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:28,595
Do you not recognize
this famous sign?

311
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:29,896
The mark ...

312
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:31,496
the "Zorro".

313
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,834
I love it!

314
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:49,514
Oh, señor! How can we
ever thank you.

315
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,850
Your gratitude is thanks enough.

316
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,587
Look! Now we
have more than before.

317
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:58,023
We took the money of the Brigand too!

318
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,693
Oooh, no señor!,
He was not a brigand.

319
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:06,531
That was Velázquez...the
Mayor's tax collector.

320
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:09,034
I know that...

321
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,403
But I'm sure you have some poor

322
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:14,840
and some needy friends who could
use a little extra dough...

323
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:18,877
Before you leave, Please.
Let me know your name...

324
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:21,546
so we can include
you in our prayers?

325
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,222
Tell me, how long have
you lived in this District?

326
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:32,057
All my life.

327
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,393
And you stay informed
of the local events...

328
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,061
the news...and the gossip?

329
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,229
Yes, señor.

330
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,398
Ah, good!, Well then ...

331
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:45,237
You recognize that famous sign, huh?

332
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:49,241
Oh, yes, sir.
It is the number 2.

333
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,743
That is not a 2.
That is a Z!

334
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:54,246
Ohhh!  If you say so señor.

335
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:58,250
But in the school that is how they
teach my granddaughter to draw a 2.

336
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,919
But I say it is a Z,
That of "Zorro"!

337
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:05,924
Zorro!
Oh, Zorro!

338
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,926
That is a little more like it!

339
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,595
Praise be to God you're back!

340
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:11,930
Spread the news.

341
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:13,432
that he is back.

342
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:16,768
To help the helpless!
To defend the friendless!

343
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:18,603
And to defeat -!

344
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:20,939
a, the defeatless.

345
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:27,779
El Zorro rides again!

346
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:41,558
This is the people's money.

347
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,295
It should be spent on
schools and hospitals.

348
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:50,336
That's the sweat of your brow they're
wearing on their backs!

349
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:52,336
The sweat of your brow...

350
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:54,172
Okay, lady, we asked you
nicely to leave once...

351
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:55,607
And now we are going to
ask -

352
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:57,309
Ask her nicely again.

353
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,311
Who are you?,
Her bodyguard?

354
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:03,315
No. I am certain the lady can
protect herself.

355
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:06,151
I am here merely to put
my sword at her disposal.

356
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,153
And if she wishes -

357
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,990
To escort her inside.

358
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:21,333
I'm a Charlotte Taylor Wilson.

359
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,502
I'm with the People's Independence
Committee.

360
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,505
And you?

361
00:27:27,673 --> 00:27:28,673
What is a name?

362
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,843
A label or brand.
Worth nothing except in the fashion world.

363
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:37,550
Ah, ah, ah. Where is
your invitation, señor bear?

364
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:07,612
Señora, May I present
Señorita Charlotte Taylor Wilson.

365
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,048
People's Independence Committee.

366
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:13,051
Here... Read all about how to fight
against the tyrants ...

367
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,886
and "tiranitas"

368
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:18,223
Thank you!

369
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,876
Now do you mind telling
me why you are

370
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,386
at my costume party
without a costume!

371
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,797
I don't believe in playing dress-up
when people are starving.

372
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,200
I hope you don't mind...

373
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,303
Why should I mind you
spoiling my party!?

374
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,972
Making me a laughing stock
in front of my friends!

375
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,708
Mind!  Don't be silly.
I don't mind.

376
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:38,543
Men!
Take this woman upstairs at once

377
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:40,979
to put on a costume
and a mask!

378
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,314
A really big mask!

379
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:45,817
Are you aware that your husband

380
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,086
is responsible for making thousands
of people miserable?

381
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,554
Really?

382
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:51,656
And I thought he was just
irritating me.

383
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:52,761
Lucky you.

384
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,162
You tall, handsome,
gorgious person.

385
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:58,930
You get to dance with
the hostess.

386
00:28:59,097 --> 00:29:00,766
Now since you know who I am,

387
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:04,603
Perhaps you could give me a
teeny, tiny hint who you are?  Hmmm?

388
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:12,377
Everyone!
He has come back...

389
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:14,379
He has come back.

390
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:17,716
- He has returned to help us.
- Who?

391
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,117
Zorro.

392
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:21,453
The Zorro!

393
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:25,624
He said his name was ... "zero"

394
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,895
He was dressed all in black,

395
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:29,895
and was accompanied by a
hideous dog!

396
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:34,966
Someone dares to commit
a crime on my first night as mayor.

397
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,138
You know, as the Mayor's wife,

398
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,639
I must play many, many
many roles.

399
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:43,709
But the people only see the part,
I play in public.

400
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:46,547
Only a few select friends

401
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:49,548
know my private parts.

402
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:06,999
This man must be made
an example of...

403
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:06,964
You hear me?

404
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:10,936
You will find him! You will bring him
to me immediately!

405
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,671
Yes, Captain!

406
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,173
There he is!

407
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,010
The man in the black sombrero?

408
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:20,679
This is him.
I am certain!

409
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:24,082
And the hideous dog you referred
to must be my wife, huh.

410
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,868
Halt!

411
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:46,269
May I cut in?

412
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,880
I think that I have arrived
just in the nick of time.

413
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:57,716
Esteban!

414
00:30:57,883 --> 00:31:00,385
You're going to ruin my party!

415
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,221
Do you agree, sir
that I have a point?

416
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:07,726
Indeed, it must difficult to find a
hat that fits it properly.

417
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:09,795
Aaaah! Señor Zero...

418
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:14,032
Is your blade as sharp
as your tongue?

419
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,569
Is yours as dull
as your wit?

420
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:22,074
- Would you mind holding this, please.
- Not at all!

421
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:25,410
Would you mind holding this, please.

422
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:28,914
Muchos Gracias!

423
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:35,587
Ah, well!

424
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,634
You are a little clumsy,
are you not, my friend?

425
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,369
To be your friend, I would have to
be more than clumsy,

426
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:26,271
I would have to be stupid!

427
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,981
Zorro! Zorro!
Zorro!

428
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,664
Now it is my turn to parry...

429
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:57,169
I can see that your pockets are
lined with the money you have stolen.

430
00:32:57,335 --> 00:33:01,840
And your shoulders are padded
with false epaulettes.

431
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:06,511
And pants bulge with greed.

432
00:33:09,014 --> 00:33:10,318
Get that man!

433
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,618
He has stolen the people's taxes!

434
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:16,719
Get him!

435
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Get him!

436
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,869
How is my party going?

437
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,870
Guards!

438
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:57,871
Guards!

439
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,901
It seems we are destined
to meet again...

440
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:05,003
I'm sorry we did not get a chance to dance.

441
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,738
Perhaps next time...

442
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:28,927
But, who are you?!

443
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:35,167
Zorro! Zorro!
Zorro!

444
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:36,601
Zorro!

445
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,437
- Zorro!
- Zorro!

446
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,107
I fear I must take my leave!

447
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,284
Shit!

448
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:55,554
Ah! He has injured his
foot, excellency.

449
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,889
Now he will be easy to find.

450
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:05,297
And now I must take my leave.

451
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:07,035
What are you... stupid?

452
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,992
I could have told you, you were
not going to make that jump?

453
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:11,470
But no, you gotta be a hero.

454
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:13,138
<i> Diego </ i>

455
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,141
<i> Can you hear me? </ i>

456
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,377
<i> I know you're up there. </ i>

457
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,982
<i> Paradise! </ i>

458
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:27,652
Diego! Diego!
I'm coming up.

459
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:30,309
You're a bad, bad, bad boy.

460
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:33,216
Why weren't you at
my party tonight?

461
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:35,327
I thought it was ...
tomorrow night.

462
00:35:35,494 --> 00:35:36,828
No!, Tonight.

463
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:40,265
Guess who showed up.
You'll never guess...

464
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,500
Zorro!

465
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,601
- Zorro?!
- Yes!

466
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,703
But Zorro, he must be
85 years old by now...

467
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,140
Well he looked marvelous.
And he made a complete fool out of Esteban.

468
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:52,678
Well, with Esteban there is so
much material to work with!

469
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:54,513
That's exactly what Zorro would
have said...

470
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,348
it's a very "Zorroesque" remark!

471
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,372
So...
Huh!

472
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,522
Ah, this is your bedroom?

473
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:12,197
And this... must be your bed.

474
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:16,368
Don't you get awful lonely up here
in this bed all by yourself?

475
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:19,704
Sometimes, Paco has nightmares
and I let him sleep with me.

476
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:22,541
My life... is a nightmare.

477
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,545
Please let me sleep with you!

478
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,311
Why are you making that face?

479
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:31,841
Is the thought of making love to me
that distasteful to you?

480
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,052
No, you're sitting on my foot!

481
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,122
Oooh!
God!

482
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:40,792
My life is miserable!

483
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,262
I have nothing.
Nothing!

484
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:45,297
Nonsense, you have everything!

485
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:49,234
You are married to the Mayor,
the Prince of the people?

486
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,737
Don't be ridiculous.

487
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:54,806
I am married to Esteban,
King of the Beasts.

488
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:56,408
A beast!

489
00:36:56,808 --> 00:37:00,812
Do you realize... That we only make
love 12 times a year?

490
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:03,815
Once a month is not too bad!

491
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,151
I mean, Twelve times in one night?

492
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:07,821
And then for the rest of the year ...

493
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:08,822
Nothing!

494
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,692
Tell me. On that one night...

495
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:16,628
Does he eat anything special?
Oysters, raw eggs?

496
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,297
Garlic.  A lot of garlic.

497
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,368
Diego, Darling.

498
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,769
Why didn't I marry
you instead of him?

499
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,603
Perhaps because he asked you
and I did not.

500
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,104
Oh, but I forgive you.

501
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:30,175
I forgive you, my darling.  There is still
time to start our life anew together.

502
00:37:30,242 --> 00:37:33,912
Take me! Take me!
Take me now, quickly!

503
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,008
What's wrong? I hear hoofbeats!

504
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,940
- It's my heart, listen.

505
00:37:45,457 --> 00:37:46,458
I sounds like it is coming closer!

506
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:54,733
- Who is it?
- The Mayor.

507
00:37:57,969 --> 00:37:58,971
Who?

508
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,006
The Mayor.

509
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:02,774
We paid on Thursday.

510
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,876
Paid on Thursday...

511
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:14,319
- His men are here!

512
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:19,491
Decrepid old crone...

513
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:22,661
It's too late,
What about under your bed?

514
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,830
No, no, no, no.
In the box.

515
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,501
Inside the fencing dummy!

516
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,674
Who is it?

517
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:38,010
Please!
Do not get up!

518
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,512
Forgive me for this late
visit, my friend.

519
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:42,848
But something most unusual
occured tonight.

520
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,751
And I need, from my heart
to talk to you.

521
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:47,853
Of course, my friend.
Whatever I can do for you.

522
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,588
Remember Zorro?

523
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,357
He re-appeared tonight.

524
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:54,893
- The Zorro.
- Yes!

525
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:56,494
He robbed one of my tax
collectors,

526
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:59,631
and then he had the audacity
to show up at my inauguratory ball.

527
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,234
What nerve!

528
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,258
Nerve?
YAAAAAAAAAH!

529
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:05,635
Of course I routed him.

530
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:11,336
He got is one or two lucky thrusts,
but in the end, he saw it was hopeless.

531
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:16,537
Zorro, back after all these years!

532
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:17,938
It's hard to believe!

533
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,039
Yes, but I'm not so sure
that this man is the real Zorro.

534
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,340
A fake Zorro?

535
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,656
What did he look like?

536
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:26,458
Well, he was ...

537
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,129
your height ...

538
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,698
your weight ...

539
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,801
your color.

540
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:42,574
By the way, my friend.

541
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:44,910
Why were you not at my party
tonight?

542
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,013
I wasn't feeling too good.

543
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:51,917
This is what's curious.

544
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:56,255
Because when this Zorro tried to
make his escape, he injured his foot.

545
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,256
Perhaps even broke it.

546
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,760
I fail to see the curiosity in that.

547
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:05,097
Maybe it's just a coincidence, perhaps.

548
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,101
But my friend, would you be so kind as to
get to your feet and walk for me?

549
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:11,903
Walk for you?

550
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:15,107
But why? You've seen me walk before.

551
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:17,978
Yes, but you always do it with such ...

552
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:22,514
manliness, that I never tire of
watching you.

553
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:27,819
Excuse me, Excellency.
This Mayor business has gone to your head.

554
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:29,821
- Walk for you?
- AHHHHHHHHHH!

555
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:31,623
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking!

556
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,959
- Hurry, hurry, Walk! Walk!
- I'm walking, I'm walking.

557
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:37,462
- Jump!
- Jump!

558
00:40:37,629 --> 00:40:39,965
- Now, running in place!

559
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:43,837
Walking and jumping and running in place!
Walking and jumping and running in place!

560
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:45,138
Walking and jumping and running in place!

561
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,306
STOOOOOP!

562
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,478
My apologies, my friend.

563
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,982
This Zorro business has upset me.

564
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:00,986
If you had only seen,

565
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,656
the way that man taunted me!

566
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,692
No, no, no!

567
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:09,161
- What is the matter?
- This uh...

568
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:12,664
This is a rare antique
that belonged to my father.

569
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:15,834
Aye! My apologies again,
my friend.

570
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,005
Sometimes ...

571
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,341
I get so angry...
AHHHHHHH!

572
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,011
Its my terrible temper!

573
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:27,846
My wife says,

574
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:29,181
it will be the death of her.

575
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:30,349
She could be right.

576
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,185
It's getting late?!

577
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,521
Ah, thank you, my friend.

578
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:39,858
And thank you for your council.

579
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:43,028
But I know from my heart
what I must do.

580
00:41:43,428 --> 00:41:46,598
I must show the people
that their Mayor will never

581
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:51,202
under any circumstances,
be intimidated!

582
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:53,705
Starting tomorrow,
more taxes!

583
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:56,207
- Good!
- Public Flogging!

584
00:41:56,274 --> 00:41:57,542
- Good!
- Look!
- What?

585
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:58,877
The dawn is breaking....

586
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:02,381
It is going to be a perfect day!

587
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:05,319
For a reign of terror!
Hurray for the Mayor!

588
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,902
Florinda, you're not hurt!

589
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:26,171
Thank God for small favors!

590
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:27,572
Do not touch me!

591
00:42:28,573 --> 00:42:30,409
Zorro may not
be able to ride.

592
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:32,244
But he can still fight.

593
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,082
On Guard!

594
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:44,089
Don't hold back, now.

595
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:58,473
REIGN OF TERROR
ENTERS THIRD WEEK

596
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:01,774
NO RELIEF IN SIGHT

597
00:43:01,775 --> 00:43:04,075
FUTURE FLOGGINGS
FORECAST

598
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,896
Esteban has gone quite mad
with power.

599
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:28,467
He has proclamed now that all the firstborn
males be named after him!

600
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,135
Even the little pets.

601
00:43:30,302 --> 00:43:32,370
There is nothing I can do about it.

602
00:43:32,638 --> 00:43:34,640
My father would be
very ashamed of me now.

603
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:38,477
To come all this distance
and miss my destiny by a ... foot.

604
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:53,225
No, no, no. I don't
wanna play no charades.

605
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,928
Are you yelling at me?

606
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,501
What?

607
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:10,409
I say! I'd like my little soldier doll with dad?

608
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:11,510
The little one?

609
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:14,179
Oh come, come.  You remember the doll
perfectly well.

610
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:18,517
Blue button eyes.  Tall hat.
The golden kennel puff-puff.

611
00:44:18,683 --> 00:44:20,852
Kennel puff-puff?

612
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:22,354
I know you!

613
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:24,189
Know me?
Certainly!

614
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:26,191
We were once womb-mates.

615
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:27,860
Womb-mates?

616
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,534
Ramon!,
Ramon!, Ramon, my brother's back!

617
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,136
<i> Incredible!
Ramon </ i>

618
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,705
Yes, I rather like that womb-mates joke.

619
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,476
After 20 years,
I can't believe it!  Ramon!

620
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,545
Well, I was Ramon twenty years ago, but

621
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:48,881
when father decided that I wasn't
quite masculine enough...

622
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:51,183
so he shipped me off to sea
in a British frigate.

623
00:44:51,216 --> 00:44:52,884
They say the Navy makes men.

624
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:55,320
Well, I'm living proof,
They made me...

625
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:57,890
Paco, take the
horse from my brother, Pronto!

626
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:04,229
You say you were Ramon,
But you're not Ramon any more?

627
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:06,565
No, no. I've discontinued
that Latin tradition.

628
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:08,467
I'm Bunny Wigglesworth, now.

629
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:11,069
I can't believe you're my brother.
You're so different!

630
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:13,071
Yes, but you're still the same, aren't you?

631
00:45:13,238 --> 00:45:16,241
- Still, tanned, bland and uh...
- Romantic, huh?

632
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:18,410
No, no, no. I was about to say
randy.

633
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,846
How did you hit your foot then?
Falling off a Tavern Maid?

634
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,418
No, I broke it fighting against ...
tyrannies and injustices.

635
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,820
for the trodden down peasants
and little babies -

636
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,989
Well, I'm sure it's all
quite an amusing little story, but ...

637
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,158
I have to go freshen up
to say Hi-Ho to the old gent.

638
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,727
Tell me...Is he as loud
as ever?

639
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:39,531
No. For the last month he's
been very...quiet.

640
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:51,944
<i> This sword...with which
to fight injustice, </ i>

641
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:55,614
<i> this mask with which to 
deceive totally</ i>

642
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:58,951
<i> this hat which needs 
reblocking</ i>

643
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:00,786
Wear them with honor <i> </ i>

644
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,190
<i> because in time of need </ i>

645
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:05,591
<i> the destiny of the Vega
to become Zorro. </ i>

646
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:06,792
Zorro!

647
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:13,465
Our father was a very
great leader of the people.

648
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:14,900
Leader of the what?

649
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:18,136
The people.  The poor and
trodden down people.

650
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:20,472
It is my destiny.

651
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,811
At this point it will be another month
before I can walk or ride.

652
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,381
And by then I'm afraid there is not going
 to be much of the people left to lead.

653
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:32,684
Yes, yes well that is far cheese, old boy.
I wish I could lend a hand.

654
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:34,653
That letter ...

655
00:46:35,153 --> 00:46:37,322
is made for both of us.

656
00:46:39,324 --> 00:46:41,159
I cannot be Zorro.

657
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:44,162
But you can!

658
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,331
Me?

659
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:48,500
Do you wish me to be Zorro?

660
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:54,339
Huh!  You mean wear that drab little costume? 
And charge about picking fights with total strangers?

661
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,175
It is our destiny.

662
00:46:57,509 --> 00:47:00,478
Yes, it's all very well for you to say!
But I don't fight!

663
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:02,247
- Surely you fence?
- I never learned.

664
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:04,049
- In the show?!
- I'm a big grouse, I'm afraid.

665
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,517
How do you defend yourself?!

666
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,453
Well, actually I'm not all that
bad with a whip...hmmm.

667
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:12,190
Yes, I can just imagine
being Zorro.

668
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:15,194
Ramon!
No need!  No need.

669
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:18,363
Very well then.
You may look now.

670
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,365
Well, what do you think?

671
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:23,035
I am speechless!

672
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:26,038
Don't you think it's a 
trifle...plain.

673
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:27,806
No, it's very classic.

674
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:31,376
But there... there is something 
that is...not right.

675
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:36,948
All I know is that these whale bones are.
absolutely excruciating.

676
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,051
How do you keep your 
boy's figure then, hmmm?.

677
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:42,454
I think I know what the problem is.

678
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:45,224
There is something wrong
with his vowels.

679
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,658
My what?

680
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:47,826
Your Vowels!

681
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,897
The way you say your "R", your "E" and "U"s,
I don't think you realize it,

682
00:47:51,964 --> 00:47:54,633
But you have a very bad accent.

683
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,602
And I do not think the people will
believe that he is really Zorro.

684
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:01,573
What if I talk very slow.

685
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,743
And make my voice
sound like...this?

686
00:48:04,944 --> 00:48:06,844
Now will the people believe me?

687
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:09,845
I think I heard you.

688
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:15,020
Help, help, the Mayor's got
all my money.

689
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:19,591
Don't you fear,
El Zorro is here!

690
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,763
But I'm afraid this costume
is not to my taste.

691
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,533
If I'm going to be this Zorro chappie, 
I want to make more of a...statement.

692
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:30,769
I want the world to recognize

693
00:48:30,936 --> 00:48:34,273
Zorro, the Gay Blade!

694
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:48,954
The tax is 10 pesos.

695
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:57,462
Next.

696
00:48:58,463 --> 00:49:00,465
You are next, señor.

697
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:06,972
Not you again?

698
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:15,790
And now, it is time for
you to pay your taxes.

699
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:17,506
Everything. All of it!

700
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,819
Peasants! Poor people!
Peasants!

701
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:24,489
Do not despair!
Tax relief is on it's way!

702
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,162
I spell relief...

703
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:34,833
Z. ..

704
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,668
O. ..

705
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:39,171
R. ..

706
00:49:39,504 --> 00:49:41,173
R. ..

707
00:49:42,174 --> 00:49:43,175
O!

708
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:44,843
Zorro!

709
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,012
Zorro!

710
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:59,191
- And he wore plum?
- Plum.

711
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:02,194
He wore a fruit?

712
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,364
No excellency. He was dressed
entirely in plum.

713
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,199
Everything matched.

714
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:09,368
And he talked differently
from the first time he robbed me.

715
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:13,205
- But...
- He sounded like a...

716
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:14,873
Poof!

717
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:19,711
Excellency! I've been robbed
by Zorro.

718
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,314
He was dressed in yellow
like a big banana!

719
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:27,386
Aha, I think he's trying to 
tell me something.

720
00:50:27,452 --> 00:50:30,722
First a plum,
then a banana.

721
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:33,392
- Mayor!
- Yes!

722
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:38,063
- Something terrible has happened.
- I know, just tell me what he wore.

723
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,332
- Green!
- Like a Lime?

724
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:42,033
Like an Avocado!

725
00:50:42,035 --> 00:50:44,871
Aha! Two fruits
and now a vegetable.

726
00:50:46,238 --> 00:50:48,673
Actually, the avocado is
a fruit Excellency.

727
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,843
Oh, no, you are right
two fruits and one vegetable.

728
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,414
- Excellency!
- What did he wear... tell me?!

729
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,748
Red.

730
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:59,851
Red like an apple or
red like a raddish.

731
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:01,753
Red, like a rose.

732
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:07,693
Aha! Two fruits, one vegetable
and one flower.

733
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,929
- Mayor! Mayor!
- Yes!

734
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:13,265
I've been robbed,
by the bandit.

735
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:17,636
- He dressed...like a salad.
- Salad? With tomato?

736
00:51:18,003 --> 00:51:20,605
and bell peppers and cucumbers -

737
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:24,109
Of course if it's a message I'm
unable to come up with the.

738
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,545
Quiet!
Quiet!

739
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:28,780
Quiet!

740
00:51:29,281 --> 00:51:31,116
Silence!

741
00:51:32,117 --> 00:51:35,787
One salad, three fruits, two ...
one

742
00:51:41,293 --> 00:51:43,064
Gentlemen!

743
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:45,465
I promise you from 
my heart

744
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:48,066
that I will cut off his
terrible culprit!

745
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:53,639
In the meanwhile, any landowner
who's taxes are stolen

746
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:56,809
MUST...MAKE UP..
THE DIFFERENCE!...

747
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,933
from his own pocket.

748
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:05,984
Silence!

749
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:09,321
Señor Obispo, you have a
motion to make?

750
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:12,057
I move we elect
a new Mayor.

751
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,662
Charge!

752
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:22,834
Zorro RETURNS
PLEDGES PEASANT PROTECTION

753
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:25,904
COLORFUL COSTUMES CAPTIVATE CROWD

754
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:30,008
MAYOR ANGRY
LANDHOLDERS DISGUSTED

755
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:51,863
Silence!

756
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,600
And remember my people
there is no shame in being poor,

757
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:57,369
only dressing poorly!

758
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:01,370
<i> Viva el Zorro!
Viva! </ I>

759
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:12,584
Zorro!

760
00:53:17,189 --> 00:53:19,191
A small donation to your cause.

761
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,527
Thank you.

762
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,399
I know it must be very boring
for you to hear all the time...

763
00:53:27,466 --> 00:53:28,800
how wonderful you are.

764
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:32,904
But I must tell you
that I admire you too.

765
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,742
Your style, your daring.

766
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:40,412
And you seem so much..
freer than most men.

767
00:53:40,946 --> 00:53:43,281
So...comfortable with yourself.

768
00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:47,552
It's the way these pants are cut...
you don't feel so constrained.

769
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:53,258
And even though we've 
hardly ever spoken...

770
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:56,928
I feel that we are partners
in this great revolution.

771
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:02,434
And anything that
you ask me to do -

772
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:05,374
I will do gladly.

773
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,375
Anything.

774
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:13,478
I know!
We can go shopping together!

775
00:54:13,645 --> 00:54:17,816
There's a new shipment of satins from
Spain ...

776
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,787
colognes from Cologne, and
Corsets from Corsica.

777
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,126
- You can trust me.
- Indeed?

778
00:54:30,028 --> 00:54:32,030
Can you trust me?

779
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:36,301
A man who wears
a mask?

780
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:42,140
I know I sound absurd.

781
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:44,676
And I am absurd.

782
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:46,812
And ridiculous.

783
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:50,115
But that is what love
does to a woman.

784
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:53,853
It makes her comical!
Extravagant!

785
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,491
Willing to say or do anything...
to please her man.

786
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:02,828
Pergrande.

787
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:18,343
Perhaps next time.

788
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,965
Well, did you, ah...
see her?

789
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:42,067
Oh, yes!

790
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,536
What do you think?

791
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:48,106
Well...

792
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,847
She is intelligent, and...

793
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:51,848
Sensitive.

794
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,549
Dedicated, in short...
to you...

795
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:58,050
I can not help it.

796
00:55:58,383 --> 00:56:00,452
She is the woman of my dreams.

797
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:02,287
Yes, why don't you look at
it this way,

798
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:05,624
In 50 years, she'll be just
another toothless old hag.

799
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:09,795
50 years with her will be 
a lifetime with anyone else.

800
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:13,331
Yes, well...She is...
Awfully sweet!

801
00:56:13,498 --> 00:56:17,502
And it was terribly nice of her to
offer herself to me.

802
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:22,007
She...offered herself?
You're sure?

803
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:28,213
Well ...perhaps offered
isn't quite the right phrase.

804
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:30,248
Shall we say that she...

805
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:36,755
She threw herself...threw herself?
Yes, that's right.  Threw herself at me.

806
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:41,093
Oh, my brother!
How lucky you are!

807
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,264
If only I could have one night
in your boots.

808
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,599
Oh my!
You think?

809
00:56:53,605 --> 00:56:55,941
<i> Diego, wake up! </ i>

810
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:57,142
Esteban!

811
00:56:58,266 --> 00:56:59,466
Out, out!

812
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:01,047
- Don Diego.
- Captain Esteban!

813
00:57:02,014 --> 00:57:03,949
Sorry, your excellency.

814
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:06,285
My humble home is
honored by your presence.

815
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:08,053
- Thank you.
- My tables, my chairs,

816
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,621
my rugs, and uh ...

817
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:11,023
Your cane?

818
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:14,426
Mi Amigo!

819
00:57:15,294 --> 00:57:16,860
You have injured yourself?

820
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:19,655
Oh, no, no, no, do not
concern yourself.

821
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:22,901
One cannot be too careful
with this Zorro fellow

822
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:24,069
running about.

823
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,571
- Yes!
- I am prepared

824
00:57:26,638 --> 00:57:28,640
Very prepared.

825
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,378
My old compadre, my heart is heavy 
to tell you...you are meek.

826
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:36,648
As always, my childhood
playmate,

827
00:57:36,715 --> 00:57:39,751
You are ... correct.

828
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:43,321
Forgive me for this late visit,
my friend.

829
00:57:43,388 --> 00:57:44,723
Please, please!

830
00:57:45,324 --> 00:57:46,992
I have to talk
to you.

831
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,226
About?

832
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:55,167
I have come up with a plan.

833
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:56,635
A plan?
Tell me.

834
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,670
To smoke out Zorro...
once and for all.

835
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:04,776
I'm going to shoot one peasant a day
until he gives himself up.

836
00:58:06,845 --> 00:58:10,282
Don't you think it's cruel and heartless,
even for you, your Excellency?

837
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,018
What if I just wounded
one peasant a day.

838
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,026
I am not thinking clearly.
This Zorro has me crazy.

839
00:58:23,528 --> 00:58:25,197
- Fruit?
- No!

840
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,700
Here is the latest "Wanted"
poster.

841
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:30,077
FOR INFORMATION LEADING
TO THE CAPTURE OF ZORRO.

842
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:31,201
A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND PESOS

843
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:35,641
For the first time...
We have a drawing of this...

844
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:37,665
red swishbuckler!

845
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:40,712
It's very good.

846
00:58:50,722 --> 00:58:52,391
Saint Mary!

847
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:53,492
What is it?

848
00:58:53,558 --> 00:58:57,062
This drawing...
Does it not remind you of anyone?

849
00:58:59,731 --> 00:59:01,567
- Zorro.
- Of course it's Zorro.

850
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:04,569
I meant...anyone else!

851
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:07,572
No, who does it remind you of?

852
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:12,644
The shallow eyes...
the shape of the head.

853
00:59:13,478 --> 00:59:16,481
The arrogant expression
I'm sorry to say, my friend...

854
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:21,687
It reminds me of you.

855
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:27,092
No, no.  I do not
see that.

856
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:30,529
My eyes are much
deeper

857
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:33,599
and my expression much
more arrogant.

858
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,435
I'm not so sure.

859
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,771
Say something like a sissy boy.

860
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:43,108
- Something like a sissy boy?
- You know what I mean.

861
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,445
Lisp...!

862
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:49,281
like thisssssssss.

863
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:56,455
Swing your hips.
Go!

864
00:59:56,521 --> 01:00:00,192
Swing your hips?
Like that?!

865
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:05,297
Good.  
Now flop your wrist.

866
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:08,467
Flop your wrists!

867
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:14,039
And now say: You're a naughty,
evil Mayor, say it!

868
01:00:14,106 --> 01:00:17,009
You're a naughty, evil, Mayor?

869
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:20,612
- I'm going to do some....
- I'm going to do some....

870
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:22,289
- terrible things..
- terrible things...

871
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:23,038
to you!.

872
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:25,615
AAAHHH!

873
01:00:25,817 --> 01:00:27,152
What am I saying?

874
01:00:29,221 --> 01:00:30,556
My friend.

875
01:00:31,156 --> 01:00:34,493
You know, you're the only
friend I have.

876
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:40,165
I know this Zorro
is somewhere close.

877
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,036
 I can almost smell him.

878
01:00:47,673 --> 01:00:49,674
- Who is this?
- Who is what?

879
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:53,679
- This man in the orange cape.
- I do not see nobody.

880
01:00:53,845 --> 01:00:57,015
- Halt! Stop!
- Stop!

881
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:03,255
Halt! 
Stop!

882
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,956
Don't run.

883
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:05,924
He's right here!

884
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:06,549
Stop!

885
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:08,327
Stop, in the name of the law!
I said to stop!

886
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:10,228
Who are you?
Who is this man?

887
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,598
That is brother Ramon, a humble priest
who has stopped here to rest.

888
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:15,967
A priest?
Tell me father ...

889
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:19,972
What order commands its priests
to wear such strange clothes.

890
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:23,475
We are followers of
Peter, the dress maker.

891
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:26,078
He, who is Christ's
taylor.

892
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:29,881
A dress maker?
Is that so?

893
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:34,219
But father, I have heard that many
of your brethren in the church...

894
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:36,488
are actually... sissy boys.

895
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:40,892
And I've heard that the Mayor
is actually a trained gorilla,

896
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:42,728
but who believes
such nonsense!

897
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,298
Well, it's late father, and we do
not wish to detain you any further.

898
01:01:47,498 --> 01:01:50,368
- So, good night.
- Most kind of you, son.

899
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,070
Father!

900
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:56,575
Pray for me.

901
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:58,911
Pray that soon ...

902
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,882
I will be face to face
with Zorro.

903
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:04,106
Please, father.

904
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,830
Thank you.

905
01:02:14,654 --> 01:02:16,354
Thank you, father.

906
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:17,763
Oh, heavenly Peter.

907
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:19,398
Oh, heavenly Peter.

908
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:21,066
He, who sews on high.

909
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,101
He who sews in the highest!

910
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:25,037
so that they may
follow in his fashion.

911
01:02:25,103 --> 01:02:27,205
so that we may follow in his fashion...

912
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:29,074
let this simple, innane man ...

913
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:31,543
let this simple, innane man ...

914
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,011
find what he seeks...

915
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:35,280
find what he seeks...

916
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,181
Thank you very much.

917
01:02:36,248 --> 01:02:37,116
Now if you'll be so kind,

918
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:39,718
- as to pray for ten seconds.
- I will pray ten seconds.

919
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:46,124
One, two, three,

920
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:48,360
four, five, six,

921
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:51,229
- Seven, eight ...
- Eight and a half.

922
01:02:51,296 --> 01:02:52,631
- Nine.
- Nine and a half.

923
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:54,299
Ten.

924
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,970
Father, with your permission.

925
01:02:58,136 --> 01:03:00,138
I'd like to give you

926
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:02,307
a small donation.

927
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:05,143
If I may, to
your Order.

928
01:03:06,812 --> 01:03:09,881
Your horse and your gold
are not gifts.

929
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:12,651
The people thank you, Mayor.

930
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:19,324
Now you mock the church!

931
01:03:19,725 --> 01:03:23,295
Now you have me and
God against you!

932
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:24,830
Me too!

933
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:26,231
Fruitcake!

934
01:03:32,203 --> 01:03:35,274
Oh! Esteban.
Please!

935
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:38,045
Can we have a 
masked ball?

936
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,111
I want a new masked
ball...

937
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:44,349
- For my pretty new necklace.
- What, are you crazy?!

938
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:48,222
The peons are starving!

939
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,323
The Landowners are 
yelling for my blood!

940
01:03:50,324 --> 01:03:51,324
Yaaah?

941
01:03:51,356 --> 01:03:54,693
If I have a masked ball
to show off your necklace ...

942
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:56,275
geez ...

943
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:02,886
- To show....Hah...Aha!
- Ha haha!

944
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:09,308
Zorro could not possibly resist
trying to steal it!

945
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:12,478
- Exactly...exactly
- A brilliant way...

946
01:04:12,479 --> 01:04:16,279
to catch a flaming phantom!

947
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,459
Esteban, I promise.
It will be so wonderful...

948
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:23,455
It will be the social event
of the season.

949
01:04:23,556 --> 01:04:24,256
Enough!

950
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:28,766
Do you know that little thing ...

951
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:31,567
we do...

952
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:34,406
one night...

953
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:35,935
every year?

954
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,236
Yes! Oooh, yes!

955
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:43,075
We still have three 
months to go!

956
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:45,744
You Beast!

957
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:08,600
- At your service!
- You look ridiculous!

958
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:11,770
Alright!

959
01:05:12,104 --> 01:05:13,605
Listen to me!

960
01:05:14,373 --> 01:05:17,943
We all know that Zorro
is tricky, si?

961
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:22,214
But we
have one advantage!

962
01:05:23,515 --> 01:05:25,183
We have the necklace.

963
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:26,952
So!

964
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,724
He must! Under any circumstances...
come to us.  Now...

965
01:05:33,192 --> 01:05:35,794
What I want is
four soldiers

966
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:38,231
surrounding my wife!

967
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:39,232
All all times!

968
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:40,665
Understood?!

969
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:42,134
Good!

970
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:44,469
What are you waiting for?
There she is.

971
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:58,250
- Esteban!
- Yes!

972
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,419
I don't like this!

973
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:01,653
Good ...

974
01:06:02,154 --> 01:06:04,323
Now remember...
stay alert.

975
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:09,328
It's cunning, he is crafty...

976
01:06:09,494 --> 01:06:13,165
He is not just going to walk
in here and say "Here I am!"

977
01:06:13,332 --> 01:06:14,666
Here I am!

978
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:19,490
Aaaaaah!
Santa Maria!

979
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:25,677
What are you waiting for?  
Here he is! Arrest him! Pronto!

980
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:28,680
What's happening here?

981
01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:32,517
I tell you something!
I am almost disappointed.

982
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:37,356
I had anticipated a greater
game of cat and mouse.

983
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:41,693
Come here!
Hurry, Pronto!

984
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:47,866
At last, to expose you...
You pilfering pansy!

985
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:49,701
Don Diego!

986
01:06:51,537 --> 01:06:55,874
Oooh, but he can't be Zorro.

987
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,877
Diego, tell him
you're not Zorro.

988
01:06:59,044 --> 01:07:02,214
Don't be silly.
I'm wearing this costume at your request.

989
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:04,983
What do you mean, my request?
I do not understand.

990
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,553
Yesterday at my house 
a servant came and said

991
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,057
that it would be your pleasure
that I come to your party dressed as Zorro.

992
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:14,702
Of course, I thought that it
was in slightly bad taste,

993
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:16,619
but after all...
You are the Mayor!

994
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:20,232
Diego, I made no
such request.

995
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:21,833
Then who?

996
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,569
Here I am.

997
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:28,940
There he is....
you rouge renegade!

998
01:07:29,974 --> 01:07:32,511
- What's the meaning of this?
- Don Jose, you are Zorro?

999
01:07:32,578 --> 01:07:34,413
- Of course not! I got a message at ...
- Here I am!

1000
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:40,419
Here he is!, Aaahh ..!
You pompous plum.

1001
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:43,589
Don Francisco,
You are Zorro?

1002
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,756
Here I am!

1003
01:07:45,123 --> 01:07:49,495
Here he is!  Ahhhhhh!
Luis!  I know you.

1004
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,900
Here!

1005
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:59,271
Now this...
is what i call a Zorro!

1006
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:01,440
This is not Zorro.

1007
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:05,944
I want Zorro!

1008
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,945
Don't you dare..
Oh!

1009
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:53,946
Oh!

1010
01:08:56,147 --> 01:08:58,647
Stop turning like idiots!
Hello, how are you?

1011
01:09:08,173 --> 01:09:09,174
Go.

1012
01:09:12,344 --> 01:09:14,012
I know he will be here.

1013
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:17,583
- Zorro would not miss this opportunity to hum...
- humiliate me.

1014
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,151
I hope you are right,
excellency.

1015
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:23,054
- Your Excellency?
- Yes!

1016
01:09:23,188 --> 01:09:26,525
May I  introduce
my cousin,

1017
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:30,696
Marguerita Wigglesworth from
Santa Barbara.

1018
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:34,867
Marguerita, our esteemed Mayor.

1019
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,203
A great honor, Señor ... Mayor.

1020
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,106
Or may i call you??

1021
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:41,407
"Al"

1022
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,548
You can call me anything you wish,

1023
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,749
My large blonde dove.

1024
01:09:53,886 --> 01:09:55,888
Come ...

1025
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:58,724
Let us dance!

1026
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:03,264
Señorita Wigglesworth,

1027
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:06,165
May I call you "Maria"?

1028
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:10,569
You can call me anything you like,
as long as you adore me.

1029
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:15,407
I tell you something Wiggie,
It is not easy being the mayor.

1030
01:10:16,074 --> 01:10:18,243
Even in the best of times.

1031
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:22,080
And especially with this...
Zorro.

1032
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:27,085
Oh, yes! Zorro.
We've heard about him in St. Barbara.

1033
01:10:27,252 --> 01:10:31,089
Someone's even wrote the nastiest
little poem about him!

1034
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:37,596
Well if it's nasty, I'll tell
you something...Wiggie!

1035
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,664
I'd love to hear it?

1036
01:10:39,765 --> 01:10:41,833
- Well now, If you insist.
- I do.

1037
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:45,103
It is called, "Ode to a Bandit".

1038
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:49,841
His clothes are bold,
his mind, uncanny,

1039
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:54,279
give him your gold,
or he'll whip your fanny!

1040
01:10:56,515 --> 01:11:00,519
People may laugh...
But I will laugh last.

1041
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:02,521
Soon I will have him.

1042
01:11:03,188 --> 01:11:08,960
I tell you Wiggie, I will be as close
to him as I am to you.

1043
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,230
And when that time comes,
my petunia,

1044
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:16,068
I will crush him in my mighty arms!

1045
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:19,638
You take my breath away!
Whatever did I say?

1046
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:25,639
This is ridiculous!

1047
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,140
I'm so embarrased!

1048
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:28,480
Calm yourselves!

1049
01:11:28,647 --> 01:11:31,149
Oh, Diego.

1050
01:11:31,173 --> 01:11:32,650
Put away those swords!

1051
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:34,653
How are you enjoying the party?

1052
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:37,322
I'm having a miserable time!

1053
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:40,559
With these buffoons
surrounding me at all times.

1054
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:41,883
Nobody can get close enough

1055
01:11:41,908 --> 01:11:43,085
to see my new necklace.
Isn't it beautiful!

1056
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:43,804
I can see it.

1057
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:45,755
It looks like it would buy the
people a lot of houses.

1058
01:11:45,831 --> 01:11:47,733
Maybe even some schools
or roads ...

1059
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:48,834
Roads!

1060
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:51,904
What do the people need roads for?
They never go anywhere.

1061
01:11:52,004 --> 01:11:53,338
Thank you.

1062
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,112
- What may I serve you, sir?
- By Margarita.

1063
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:01,680
Four Margueritas.

1064
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:03,015
Dear cousin??

1065
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:08,854
I would like you to meet the Mayor's
lovely wife and her beautiful necklace.

1066
01:12:15,527 --> 01:12:18,030
You clumsy cow!

1067
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,798
Look what you've done?

1068
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:23,568
- A thousand pardons, Señora.
- Don't you touch me!

1069
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:25,669
Get out of my way!

1070
01:12:25,972 --> 01:12:29,608
- Ruining my dress!
- Let me help you!

1071
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:34,713
This is one place...
you can't go with me!

1072
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:38,884
But I can!

1073
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:42,788
Oh my God!
Not you again!

1074
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:44,790
Stay away from me
You've done enough damage.

1075
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,459
I don't think it will stain
but if it does, cheap is cheap!

1076
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:50,896
- You horrid, wretched woman!
- Oh, what lovely skin you've got.

1077
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,464
You must stay out of the sun.

1078
01:12:52,564 --> 01:12:55,968
If you don't stop touching me, 
I shall have you...destroyed!

1079
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,736
- Stop it!
- Calm down!

1080
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,572
Your cousin is not a woman.

1081
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,478
She is a goddess.

1082
01:13:10,248 --> 01:13:14,586
- Oh, I feel faint.
- Well, sit down and get some air.

1083
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:16,987
I hate masked balls.
Don't you hate masked balls?

1084
01:13:16,988 --> 01:13:20,188
The masks are so uncomfortable.

1085
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:21,189
Let me!

1086
01:13:21,127 --> 01:13:22,824
Sit down! Now take deep breaths!

1087
01:13:22,849 --> 01:13:25,288
Deep, deep breaths,
that's it, deep breaths.

1088
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:28,415
That's it....

1089
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,609
I don't know how someone
could let themselves get so large!

1090
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,510
It's disgusting!

1091
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:45,684
Where is Wigglesworth -
Your neck!

1092
01:13:45,685 --> 01:13:48,885
Did that woman bruise me?!
She's got hands like a gorilla!

1093
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:52,624
Neck! Neck!
Neck! Necklace!

1094
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:02,801
Zorro!

1095
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:13,979
Santa Maria! How could
I have been so decieved.

1096
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,980
You?

1097
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,650
I promised to take him on a picnic.

1098
01:14:25,157 --> 01:14:28,827
Well done, my brother.
Now what?

1099
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,830
In two days, my ship
sails for England.

1100
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:36,334
Tell Esteban he can write Wiggie
care of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth.

1101
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:38,003
But only if he's serious.

1102
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,505
My brother, you are like
nobody else.

1103
01:14:41,406 --> 01:14:43,075
What am I going to do
without you.

1104
01:14:43,175 --> 01:14:44,743
Well now that your foot's healed,

1105
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:47,346
Why don't you deliver this bauble
to Charlotte Taylor Wilson?

1106
01:14:47,513 --> 01:14:50,182
And give her...
my love.

1107
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:52,684
Or better yet...
Yours.

1108
01:14:52,851 --> 01:14:55,187
But ... 
It's you that she loves.

1109
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,357
No!. 
It's Zorro she loves.

1110
01:15:01,193 --> 01:15:03,595
I'll never forget the look
in her eyes when she said:

1111
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:09,100
Love ... A bit absurd,
ridiculous, comical.

1112
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:12,871
A woman willing to do anything
to please her man.

1113
01:15:13,038 --> 01:15:14,706
She said that to you?

1114
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,378
Said it??! Sink me!
She almost sang it!

1115
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:25,050
I must go to her. You... You've done
more than - Thank you brother!

1116
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,556
I must try that line
myself some time.

1117
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:34,262
I am absurd, ridiculous, comical!
Extravagent!

1118
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:37,463
No.  Who'd ever believe
that of me?

1119
01:15:45,904 --> 01:15:50,409
This is your revolution...
Your independence.

1120
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:55,580
I can't do it for you.

1121
01:15:56,414 --> 01:16:00,752
Some nights are better
for romance...

1122
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:04,089
than revolution.

1123
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:09,428
It's very sultry tonight.

1124
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:11,429
I've never seen -

1125
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:21,773
This isn't for me.

1126
01:16:22,107 --> 01:16:23,775
It's beaut..

1127
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:25,777
It looks better on you.

1128
01:16:25,944 --> 01:16:28,447
After all, you are
a person too.

1129
01:16:28,614 --> 01:16:33,118
And ... a woman.

1130
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:56,042
You're hot!

1131
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:00,812
Have a little water?
don't feel too good?

1132
01:17:03,982 --> 01:17:05,317
Oh, Diego.

1133
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,752
Diego?

1134
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:09,821
- You knew it was me?
- Yes

1135
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:13,492
- How long have you known?
- Since the start, I think.

1136
01:17:14,226 --> 01:17:16,829
At first I thought there were
two of you.

1137
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:19,064
Well ... you see ...
At the beginning, I had...

1138
01:17:19,164 --> 01:17:24,836
But then I realized it was just 
two sides of one man, who was changing.

1139
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:26,905
You are the reason for the change.

1140
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:30,176
Now I know it is permitted
for a man to be...

1141
01:17:30,177 --> 01:17:31,677
Bulnerable.

1142
01:17:31,878 --> 01:17:34,778
It's Vul-ne-ra-bel.
Vulnerable.

1143
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:36,779
Vulnerable.

1144
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:40,480
Vul-ne-ra-bel.

1145
01:17:40,481 --> 01:17:41,481
oh my...

1146
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:51,029
I love you.

1147
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:56,468
I love you jealously, always,
even if you're a little crazy.

1148
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:01,940
And I love you, Don Diego Vega.
Even if you are a little rich.

1149
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:08,880
<i> Señor Zorro!
The soldiers! </ i>

1150
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,650
Soldiers!
You must go.

1151
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,887
- Go.
- Not for long.

1152
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:23,662
And when I return...

1153
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:27,099
We will not have to
worry about how to pronounce "Brigen"

1154
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:28,567
Virgin!

1155
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:29,968
Virgin!

1156
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:38,969
<i> Halt! </ i>

1157
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:58,997
And with my own eyes, I saw
Zorro gave her your wife's necklace.

1158
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:02,767
If you arrest the blonde señorita
Then Zorro will come to you.

1159
01:19:02,934 --> 01:19:04,936
I should have thought
of that myself.

1160
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:08,440
- Thank you.
- It is an honor.

1161
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,944
- to be a servant to his Excellency.
- I'm not paying a reward.

1162
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:16,281
Of course I would not expect a reward
until he is captured.

1163
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:18,050
A reward?

1164
01:19:18,617 --> 01:19:21,120
Si.
Meanwhile, your Excellency,

1165
01:19:21,286 --> 01:19:24,956
I live with my mother,
three sisters and three brothers.

1166
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:29,828
Your Excellency, I have prayed 
for a small room of my own.

1167
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:32,798
Your prayers are answered.
Lock him up inside the barracks!

1168
01:19:32,965 --> 01:19:37,069
Excellency, excellency!
I want no reward!

1169
01:19:43,475 --> 01:19:48,980
She loves me. She loves me.
She loves me.

1170
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:51,984
Paco, where have you been?

1171
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:55,654
Calm down Paco.
I cannot see what you are saying.

1172
01:19:56,989 --> 01:19:59,992
Esteban ...
Esteban's men.

1173
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,494
have gone to arrest...

1174
01:20:02,995 --> 01:20:05,664
Charlotte Taylor Wilson!
Santa Maria!

1175
01:20:16,675 --> 01:20:21,613
So this is what you've stooped to,
murdering innocent women.

1176
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:28,687
Look!, Just between us...

1177
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:34,026
There is not going to be any woman shot.
This is just a plan of mine to get Zorro.

1178
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:37,062
Idiot!

1179
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:39,932
Do you really think Zorro
 is going to sacrifice his own life

1180
01:20:40,032 --> 01:20:43,368
just to save that blonde,
skinny whore.

1181
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:45,871
I know from my heart
he will...

1182
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:54,046
How romantic.
Do you would sacrifice your life for me?

1183
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:57,482
Please! Don't make me laugh.
My stomach is upset already.

1184
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:02,614
Do you wish... 
Stop!

1185
01:22:04,783 --> 01:22:06,785
Do you wish for a blindfold?

1186
01:22:07,953 --> 01:22:09,121
No.

1187
01:22:11,123 --> 01:22:13,461
The eyes of freedom ...

1188
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,462
will always see through
the blindfolds of tyranny.

1189
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:20,367
The bonds of oppression...

1190
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,868
will always be broken

1191
01:22:22,968 --> 01:22:24,970
by the muscles of Liberty.

1192
01:22:43,155 --> 01:22:45,725
The people are very
restless, your excellency.

1193
01:22:45,726 --> 01:22:47,326
I would not wait too much longer.

1194
01:22:47,326 --> 01:22:48,494
Lady killer!

1195
01:22:48,495 --> 01:22:50,495
<i> Attention! </ i>

1196
01:22:55,167 --> 01:23:00,672
Father, please pray that Zorro
is delivered to me, pronto.  Si?

1197
01:23:07,513 --> 01:23:10,081
Your prayers are answered, Excellency.

1198
01:23:10,182 --> 01:23:12,851
I knew it!

1199
01:23:12,852 --> 01:23:14,852
<i>Ready!</i>

1200
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:17,189
Stop them.

1201
01:23:17,256 --> 01:23:20,592
No. I know you would not kill
an innocent man.

1202
01:23:21,193 --> 01:23:22,796
Or me either, for that matter.

1203
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:23,797
<i> Aim! </ i>

1204
01:23:32,871 --> 01:23:35,874
- Release her, and I am yours.
- Halt!

1205
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:40,212
I've always depended on 
people being nicer than me.

1206
01:23:40,879 --> 01:23:43,882
And I have never, in my
life, been disappointed.

1207
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:48,554
Guards!
Untie her!

1208
01:23:49,221 --> 01:23:51,557
Hear me!

1209
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:55,894
Your Mayor has promised
you Zorro!

1210
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:00,565
No!

1211
01:24:02,234 --> 01:24:04,570
The Mayor has brought you
Zorro!

1212
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:14,112
Ahhh, 
Muchos Gracias!

1213
01:24:14,913 --> 01:24:17,916
And now ...
for the unmasking.

1214
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:20,919
I ask the Mayor for
one condition!

1215
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:23,488
The requests are mine now,
Zorro! Not yours!

1216
01:24:23,588 --> 01:24:25,591
Out of respect for my family!

1217
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,360
I do not wish to be
unmasked publically!

1218
01:24:38,103 --> 01:24:41,440
The say that the mayor
is heartless and cruel!

1219
01:24:42,607 --> 01:24:45,944
But he respects the
last wish of a gallant adversary!

1220
01:24:54,286 --> 01:24:55,789
<i> NO! </ i>

1221
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,290
<i> NO! </ i>

1222
01:24:58,323 --> 01:24:58,960
Bring down the girl!

1223
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,261
Tie him up.

1224
01:25:02,562 --> 01:25:03,262
Go.

1225
01:25:04,963 --> 01:25:07,299
You are bravest man
I have ever met.

1226
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:09,968
I am impressed with
myself too...

1227
01:25:16,475 --> 01:25:18,644
- Isn't he marvelous?
- He wears clothes well.

1228
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,079
I could never get
into his pants.

1229
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,681
I bet I could.

1230
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:25,817
Sergeant!
Read the charges.

1231
01:25:25,984 --> 01:25:29,988
Zorro, the bandit.
For crimes against the people,

1232
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:35,093
And against the country and against
the state, the city, and the villiage.

1233
01:25:35,193 --> 01:25:37,863
you are sentenced to be executed ...

1234
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:39,564
until you are dead.

1235
01:25:39,664 --> 01:25:40,999
NOOOO!

1236
01:25:44,236 --> 01:25:46,238
I have only one regret!

1237
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:49,274
One?  I have one for every day
I'm not going to live.

1238
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,844
That you will not live to 
see the glorious revolution...

1239
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,779
that you have brought about!

1240
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:55,180
Ready!

1241
01:25:55,848 --> 01:25:57,350
Why doesn't she say something like...

1242
01:25:58,017 --> 01:26:00,352
I'm going to love you forever?
Why doesn't she say that?

1243
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:02,521
Aim!

1244
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:07,125
I will love you forever!

1245
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:14,700
<i> Two Bits...
four bits... </ i>

1246
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:16,535
<i> Six bits. A peso! </ i>

1247
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:19,538
<i> All for Zorro, </ i>

1248
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:21,140
Stand up and say so!

1249
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,375
<i> Zorro! Zorro!
Zorro! Zorro!! </ I>

1250
01:26:36,221 --> 01:26:38,623
I knew would never be able
to do this by yourself.

1251
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:40,559
What are you talking about?
I was doing fine!

1252
01:26:40,725 --> 01:26:42,894
Fine?  Silly boy, another second and
you'd have had 5 bullets in you.

1253
01:26:42,995 --> 01:26:44,896
Admit it.  You just love
the attention.

1254
01:26:45,096 --> 01:26:46,890
Actually, I had this outfit
and I thought to myself...

1255
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,324
"Where might I
possibly wear it?".

1256
01:26:48,734 --> 01:26:49,901
Shoot them both!

1257
01:26:50,068 --> 01:26:52,738
<i> Zorro </ i>

1258
01:26:53,906 --> 01:26:55,474
Where is he getting
all these men!

1259
01:26:55,574 --> 01:26:57,576
I say, I rather like that myself!

1260
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,848
You do?  You must be
betting on them!

1261
01:27:10,923 --> 01:27:12,557
How can there be
two of you?

1262
01:27:12,657 --> 01:27:15,527
You will understand when the revolution
makes Zorros of everyone!

1263
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:18,528
Soldiers!
Soldiers!

1264
01:27:58,637 --> 01:27:59,875
Guards!

1265
01:27:59,876 --> 01:28:02,976
I want the names of everyone
 who has a stick.

1266
01:28:03,142 --> 01:28:05,477
Tell the lady I want her name!

1267
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:08,814
Guards!
Arrest everybody!

1268
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:13,485
Guards!

1269
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:34,006
Florinda.

1270
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,843
At least I know you will not desert me.

1271
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:39,845
Right?

1272
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:41,746
Wow, I'm glad to see

1273
01:28:41,847 --> 01:28:44,183
you're finally developing a
sense of humor, Esteban.

1274
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:46,184
Excuse me.

1275
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:13,211
Well, now you have had your
revolution.  And now?

1276
01:29:15,547 --> 01:29:17,116
Now, I thought maybe
I'd do something

1277
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:20,886
about increasing the number of voters
in this country.

1278
01:29:22,221 --> 01:29:25,224
It means you will do much
travel, no?

1279
01:29:25,324 --> 01:29:26,658
No.

1280
01:29:26,725 --> 01:29:30,729
I thought maybe I'd do it by settling down,
getting married and having...

1281
01:29:31,229 --> 01:29:32,898
a bunch of kids.

1282
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:41,573
I'm going to give you the biggest
wedding you have ever had!

1283
01:29:49,414 --> 01:29:51,416
What would you like
for a wedding present?

1284
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,485
For myself?
Nothing.

1285
01:29:53,585 --> 01:29:56,588
But I thought, for the 
people, you might donate your land.

1286
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:58,423
If I give my land to the people?

1287
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,260
If we give away my land
Where do you think we are gonna live?

1288
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,362
- Boston.
- Boston?!

1289
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:06,765
It is really the only civilized city.
The best food,

1290
01:30:06,932 --> 01:30:08,800
the best art,
and the best music.

1291
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,502
The best music?
You got to be joking!

1292
01:30:10,602 --> 01:30:12,170
I spent a week
Boston once,

1293
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:15,941
and I don't think I heard
a decent mariachi player in the city!
